what's my point
why you should care


Me in bullet points (doesn't hurt though):

- using humour a lot, rarely successfuly (though 100% with myself)
- grew up in a family of small entrepreneurs
- immersed in B2B Sales since childhood (my mother was a freelance sales agent in the automobile industry.. in the 80s!)
- successful in all my roles (ie all companies have attempted to retain me when I wished to leave, some succeeding a few times in a row)
- not a social person (ie uncomfortable in social interactions)
- rapidly bored, always need to do new things to keep me intellectually attentive and engaged
- lazy hard worker - I work x/7 ("always-on"), up to 12+ hours/day if and when needed, but favour working on systems and anything with leverage (eg content creation) rather than tasks.
- system thinker - architected 2 platforms in my 2 bootstraped startups, and aim to build systems, processes and automations wherever possible (down to the task level)
- lived in 4 countries (FR, AT, GB, DE), planning for the 5th (IT) - European at heart
- worked 6 years in France for French companies, only for US (and Australian) companies since, besides my own startups
- speaking 3 languages (English, French & German), though none perfectly. English has become my primary language (sorry Moli√®re) whenever possible - I think in English.
- learned programming late in life
- programming in Python now my hobby
- on the spectrum (Asperger syndrom), which explains probably some of the rest
