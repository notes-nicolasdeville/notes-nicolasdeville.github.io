<p>A lot of good things in life come after negotiation (or after a strike, if I‚Äôd be a proper Frenchman perhaps? üá´üá∑ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), not on a silver platter .</p>
<p>And this applies also to life in business even more, and for everyone, not just in Sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>negotiate a raise</li>
<li>negotiate a promotion</li>
<li>negotiate the right to work from home</li>
<li>negotiate a holiday</li>
<li>negotiate an extended deadline</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>So learning the basics of negotiation can benefit anyone.</p>
<p>And while it takes a lifetime of learning to become an expert at it, you can apply the Pareto principle - knowing the 20% that will yield 80% of the result.</p>
<p>Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Putting yourself in the other one's shoes</strong> (see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/careerplaybook-011-putting-yourself-in-the-other-ones-shoes/">#CareerPlaybook 011</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Anchoring</strong>: the higher you start, the higher you'll end</li>
<li><strong>Leverage</strong>: knowing (even increasing where possible) and using your leverage (the value you have) is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong>: being proactive in creating a deal structure that will be a win-win.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.negotiations.com/articles/best-alternative/">BATNA</a></strong> (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement): have a Plan B when entering negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learning the basics</h2>
<p>There are tons of resources to help youÔøº learn just what you need, to get more of what you want.</p>
<p>Two book recommendations, that are very accessible for anyone:</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended-ebook/dp/B014DUR7L2/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0">Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It</a>" by Chris Voss and Tahl Raz</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/02/CP012_NeverSplitTheDifference.jpg">"<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-agreement-without-ebook/dp/B008YUNDJS/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0">Getting to Yes: Negotiating an agreement without giving in</a>" by Roger Fisher and William Ury</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/02/CP012_GettingToYes.jpg">Regarding anchoring (the principles around price setting and its effects), the book "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Priceless-Myth-Fair-Value-Advantage-ebook/dp/B003DRO5OY/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0">Priceless</a>" by William Poundstone is eye-opening.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/02/CP012_Priceless.jpg">If you do not want to invest the time in reading a whole book, Harvard's Law School's "<a href="https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/top-10-negotiation-skills/">Top 10 Negotiation Skills You Must Learn to Succeed</a>" post and their <a href="https://www.pon.harvard.edu/category/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/?cid=13">Negotiation Skills blog series</a> is a good resource.</p>
<p>Learning to read one's body language and face expressions is also a valuable skill in negotiation. We'll address this in a future post.</p>
<h2>It will pay many times over</h2>
<p>As per <a href="https://nicolasdeville.com/careerplaybook-001-always-be-learning/">#CareerPlaybook 001: Always Be Learning</a>, having a specific project in mind is the best way to learn a new skill.</p>
<p>What are you longing for at the moment in your workplace?</p>
<p>Make that your goal and learn to negotiate with it in mind.</p>
<p>It will be a useful skill throughout your life, in a lot of different situations, even if you just know the basics of it. You will be able to get more of what you want.</p>
