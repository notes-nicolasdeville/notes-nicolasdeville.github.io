<p>Key traits in an AI world:<br>
- adaptability <br>
- system thinking<br>
- human connection</p>
<p><span class="datestamp">20 Jan 2023</span> </p>
<p>Extrapolate progress in generative AI &amp; brain interfaces to a not so far future, and we should be able to visualise &amp; share recordings of our dreams and visual thoughts.  </p>
<p>This will unlock a new level of human creativity &amp; communication possibilities.  </p>
<p><span class="datestamp">31 Jan 2023</span> </p>
<p>The threat of population collapse is counter-intuitive, as we have now reached 8 billion people on Earth.<br>
Yet last week alone, Japan &amp; Italy have raised the alarm that their countries might not be able to function, and their health system fail, if the birth rate continues to trend down.</p>
<p>This might be a temporary (decades long) issue, if new policies &amp; societal changes help get this trend back up.</p>
<p>But the more I think about it, the more I think AI can be part of the solution.</p>
<p>Instead of fearing it taking jobs away, it can help empower a dwindling active population to be more productive, thus helping supporting economically an ever-growing aging population.</p>
<p>It's a complex topic though. </p>
<p>Has anyone looked into this topic in depth?</p>

<h1 id="ai">AI</h1>
<p><span class="datestamp">01 Feb 2023</span>   </p>
<p>A few tools (incl. from OpenAI) are in the works to help detect if something has been created by an AI or a human.  </p>
<p>I think broadly an AI-detecting AI is a short-term, knee-jerk reaction to a new technology society fears and will need to adapt to.   </p>
<p>Everyone will use AI assistants in the future.   </p>
<p>And as we have started to see, two different people using the same AI will get different results. Knowing what &amp; how to ask the AI is a skill in itself.    </p>
<p>But if you take school curriculums for example, they will need to evolve anyway - there has been a disconnect between what is taught (and how) and what people need in the workplace &amp; life, for a long time already.<br>
The gap is just widening exponentially now.  <br>
It's about rethinking what and how we teach, rather than keeping the status quo and fighting the rise of AI.  </p>
<p>Plus there are risks of false positives and false negatives.  </p>
<p>Sure there are use cases where an AI-detecting AI will have a role, eg to combat the spread of misinformation and deepfakes used for nefarious purposes.   </p>
<p>But ultimately what matters in most cases is output quality - not how the output was created.    </p>
<hr>
<p>Do we really care how something good has been created?  </p>
<p>Given the choice between something sub-par created 100% by a human or something better created partly or fully by an AI, which would you choose?  </p>
<hr>
<p>Give it a few years and "can I speak with your AI?" might become the new "can I speak with your supervisor?".  </p>
<hr>
<p>Will AI replace jobs?  </p>
<p>In some cases, yes, but mostly:<br>
1) it will replace people not good at the job or with low human added-value<br>
2) it will enhance &amp; empower people good at the job, who embrace AI<br>
3) it will create new jobs</p>
<hr>
<p>NFTs might see a revival in the years ahead (under a new name I hope) as a way to prove that a piece of content was created by a human.   </p>

<p>Carl Wilhelm Hagander 🦆 I think about the human interaction factor in the rise of AI, and I'm split on that one...   </p>
<p>(disclaimer: I'm an introvert who likes efficiency, so probably on the wrong side of the argument :)  </p>
<p>My current thinking, in a world where AI output is trusted to be better and more consistent than humans, is:   </p>
<ul>
<li>in most cases, in a business setting, once the digital-native generations represent the largest majority of white collars, an efficient AI interaction will be preferred (ie do more in less time, with a higher certainty of quality output)  </li>
<li>this in turn will augment the need/desire for authentic human interactions in one's personal life  </li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, I might be wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️   </p>

<p>Joey Gilkey Agree with your underlying message. Though it's about focusing on signal vs noise.  </p>
<p>And extrapolating what (generative) AI will be able to do in the years to come - always gotta learn &amp; adapt.   </p>
<p>The flipside question would be: If you were good at X before, how much better can you/will you be with AI assistants?   </p>

<p>I think the evolution of wealth distribution is a complex and dynamic process - hard to argue in 300 characters.   </p>
<p>Plus I'm a "glass half full" kinda guy :) Doesn't matter if a small number of people get richer, as long as overall wealth distribution gets better in the process 🤷🏻‍♂️   </p>
<p>Also the flipside I've been thinking about recently - with Italy &amp; Japan raising alarm over falling birth rates and upcoming potential collapse of their society &amp; health systems - is the promise of AI to empower a dwindling number of active workers to be more effective/productive, so as to be able to support an ever-growing aging population. 🤔   </p>
<p><span class="datestamp">08 Feb 2023</span> </p>
<p>A few years from now, an AI should sit at every meeting table.  </p>
<p>To:  </p>
<ul>
<li>take notes / transcribe</li>
<li>send summary &amp; action points to attendees<br>
but also:</li>
<li>fact-check based on both internal &amp; external data sources</li>
<li>provide an additional opinion</li>
<li>help brainstorms ideas</li>
<li>keep the meeting on track / ensure goals are met</li>
<li>assess participation and raise flags if underrepresentation</li>
<li>suggest ways to improve meeting efficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>Love this. A good counter-balance to the overall backlash against AI's inaccuracies.. as if humans &amp; mainstream media would never be wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️  </p>
<p>That being said, generative AI needs to improve with:  </p>
<p>1) correcting the "hallucinations" phenomenon<br>
2) hyperlink to sources<br>
3) indicate confidence score  </p>
<p>Early days still.. 5 years from now these teething issues will be forgotten.   </p>
<p><span class="datestamp">11 Feb 2023</span> </p>
<p>(Human + AI) &gt; (Human or AI)    </p>
<p>Human + AI will outperform Human or AI for a long time. </p>
<p><span class="datestamp">14 Feb 2023</span>  </p>
<p>A few years ago, experts were saying that creativity will remain the remit of humans for a long time. Proven wrong very quickly.  </p>
<p>When thinking now about what will remain a "human" trait in this new dawn of AI, curiosity (ie asking good questions) came to my mind.  </p>
<p>It's what has propelled humanity to explore, discover &amp; evolve.   </p>
<p>But developing a curious AI is probably around the corner too 🤷🏻‍♂️  </p>
<p>Re Sales, I think the impact, at scale, will take 5 years rather than 2. But it will be profound.   </p>
<p>True value will be unlocked once any company is able to easily train its own large language model on its own data, best performers' playbook, target industries, etc..  </p>
<p>Combined with progress in other areas (eg automation), my best guess is that you'll be able to get the same output with 60% less salespeople + AI.  </p>
<p>Fascinating times ahead.   </p>
<p><span class="datestamp">29 Mar 2023</span> </p>
<p>Yes. It's going too fast at the moment, without railguards. I'm excited by the progress, understand the underlying technology, and don't fear any sentient AI. "Hallucinations" in text replies are a non-issue. But danger lies in:<br>
- ideological bias (this is a big step from solely commercial bias, in a democracy)<br>
- powerful &amp; easy deepfake video &amp; audio generation accessible to all<br>
- most importantly: easy access to AI generating &amp; executing code</p>
<p><span class="datestamp">28 Apr 2023</span> </p>
<p>AI dangers  </p>
<ul>
<li>ability to manipulate humans with better-than-human persuasion, based on the entire web &amp; social media data.   </li>
<li>trained on lies as well as truths, with no moral compass.</li>
<li>agents bring a whole other level of autonomy &amp; risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI / Yann LeCun</p>
<p>I don't think anyone says "stupid enough" - maybe just "not intelligent enough" as a human species considering the speed at which super-powerful AI can develop itself at some point and the ramifications for good and bad it creates.</p>
<p>Just like Facebook did not predict the negative consequences of its algorithm, on society &amp; people.</p>
<p>Could lead to have unintentionally harmful consequences at a much larger scale than the first few cars and planes you take as example.</p>
<p>And we have learned with cars and planes that regulation is needed to ensure broad safety.</p>
<p>I respect your decades of experience &amp; knowledge, but AI timeline &amp; expected capabilities have been mis-forecasted before by many experts.</p>
<p>You might/will be not at fault yourself if a powerful AI goes rogue -  it might/will be someone else. It's about protection across the board.</p>
<p>Let's just have at least a regulation around implementations of hardware &amp; software fail-safes.</p>
