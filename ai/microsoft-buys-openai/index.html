<p>If they close it, I think it's a steal for Microsoft (eg compare with Linkedin's full acquisition at a mature stage for $26B vs potential of OpenAI) - and OpenAI's best bet at AI "domination" (or as close as it gets), at the same time.    </p>
<p>My mind has been racing for a while about what this association can mean - for the future of AI, business and the economy (GDP) at large...   </p>
<p>It was already clear that Microsoft's plan was to leverage the technology to improve their products and services.   </p>
<p>They had a strategic relationship with OpenAI since 2019 and were on the cap table already, albeit as a minority shareholder. I saw this as a "Kickstarter investment".. investing, but primarly to get prime access to the technology.   </p>
<h2 id="github-copilot-a-successful-proof-of-concept">Github Copilot: a successful Proof Of Concept</h2>
<p>And they have already started leveraging OpenAI's technologies in their products, such as Github Copilot - an "AI pair programmer", or "AI code writing assistant", ie auto-complete for code.<br>
(Microsoft bought Github - a code repository, where developers store their code - in 2018 for $7.5B. Copilot is a paid-for add-on to Github)     </p>
<p>I'm writing this note in VS Code (a Microsoft product) - the IDE of choice for many (most) developers these days it seems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IDE, or Integrated Development Environment = the app that programmers use to write code  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img class="screenshot" src="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/images/ai/vs-code-example.jpg" alt="ai/vs-code-example.jpg"/>  </p>
<p>And I have the Github Copilot (GC) extension installed.  </p>
<p>I have been using GC every day since November <span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/ai/github-copilot" target="_blank">Github Copilot</a></span> - and I love it. It saves me time and keeps impressing me. Is it perfect? No. But it's better than without it, and it will keep getting better.    </p>
<p>Before that, I had seen only praises for Github Copilot (in my algorithmic and/or mental bubble perhaps?). </p>
<p>It was announced in 2021 and came out of beta last June.     <br>
Actually it was Andrej Karpathy (former Head of AI at Tesla) on Lex Fridman's podcast, saying he "wouldn't code without it anymore" that made me try it.  <br>
This is a strong statement from someone like him on a new product.
And like him, after a couple months of use, I couldn't code without it anymore.   </p>
<p>A perfect example of Product-Market Fit <span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/startups/product-market-fit" target="_blank">Product Market Fit (PMF)</a></span>.       </p>
<p>Side note: the quasi-dominance of Microsoft (with VS Code and Github) in the developer space is mind-blowing to me. 
Especially when considering what Microsoft was 20 years ago (the antithesis of open-source).  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Satya Nadella will go down as one of the greatest Tech CEOs of all time. 
His turnaround of Microsoft, and 3D chess moves of acquisitions, are incredible. <br>
I recommend his autobiography "Hit Refresh": <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hit-Refresh-Memoir-Microsofts-CEO-ebook/dp/B06XX4KH4R/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hit-Refresh-Memoir-Microsofts-CEO-ebook/dp/B06XX4KH4R/ref=sr_1_1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Microsoft + OpenAI's POC (Proof Of Concept) with developers is a success.   </p>
<p>Now onto the business world.   </p>
<h2 id="business-world">Business world</h2>
<p>Microsoft has ~85% of the market share in the desktop Operating System market. </p>
<p>Outside of the Tech industry, most people use Windows &amp; the Office suite for productivity.    </p>
<p>In other words, the vast majority of business computers, ie what powers knowledge workers across the world and thus the global economy (at a low level).   </p>
<p>Now let's take what Microsoft has done with Github Copilot in the Developers' world in a short amount of time and apply it to the Business world - and think long-term...</p>
<p>There are synergies across the entire MSFT portfolio of products, with OpenChat-like and DALL-E like capabilities anywhere &amp; everywhere.    </p>
<ul>
<li>in the Office suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) </li>
<li>in Linkedin</li>
<li>in Windows (desktops and tablets), ie embedded in everything you do on your computer</li>
<li>in a reborn Bing (currently a "ghost" search engine), which will be able to take the fight up with Google, with a shot at becoming the main (AI) search engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the foundation of productivity for most computer workers will be boosted - just like what Github Copilot has started doing with developers.     </p>
<p>Let's not forget also that:   </p>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI has started to cover the array of generative AI (text and images - video soon I imagine) but also other areas of useful AIs like speech-to-text (with Whisper which is really good - see <span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/ai/whisper" target="_blank">Whisper</a></span>, tested myself with <span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/projects/transcribee" target="_blank">Transcribee</a></span>).    </li>
<li>all of these are still in their infancy (ie just released out of Beta last year or open to the public as "Research release")</li>
<li>other projects &amp; products are brewing under the hood</li>
<li>the pace of progress is accelerating</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction by Co-founder of OpenAI 🚀 <a href="https://t.co/9IKXdhCOIF">https://t.co/9IKXdhCOIF</a></p>&mdash; Nic (@ndeville) <a href="https://twitter.com/ndeville/status/1609565183323545604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI provides its AIs as APIs so an entire ecosystem of companies will license its technology to build new features or entire companies on top of it.   </li>
</ul>
<p>Now where it will become even more interesting is that I expect at some point in the future, OpenAI will be able to have its AIs trained on the full scope of Microsoft-generated content.  </p>
<p>Or in other words, each company will be able to train its own AI on its own data.   </p>
<p>So the "AI-Assistants everywhere" will be able to generate content and answers that are specific to the company, its products, its customers, its industry, its brand guidelines, etc.  </p>
<p>This means that all knowledge workers will be empowered to do more, faster and better. <br>
Increasing productivity and efficiency of all workers, and thus the economy at large (in terms of GDP).    </p>
<p>As this early stage of Github Copilot (it will improve as it keeps learning) I see time savings of say 20% - meaning 1) I can do more and 2) this number will increase.   </p>
<p>Translate this now from low-level, at scale, to high-level - what will the impact be on global GDP ($100 Trillion as it stands)? </p>
<p>What will be the impact on Microsoft's revenues, valuation and stock price?    </p>
<p>The potential is huge.    </p>
<p>Will some jobs get lost in process? Sure.   </p>
<p>But mostly:  </p>
<p>1) AI will not replace your job, People using AI (better) will replace your job. <br>
2) New kinds of jobs will appear, and I believe the uplift in productivity, thus in economic results, will be so great that the net effect will be positive (which I formulate here as a conservative understatement - the potential is far greater).  </p>
<p>Now, could Microsoft have done that without buying a full 49% of OpenAI?  </p>
<p>Sure, but at what cost? </p>
<p>And they would have benefitted only modestly from a financial standpoint of the position they will bring OpenAI to.   </p>
<p>What's in it for OpenAI?  </p>
<ul>
<li>getting the compute then need (ie server time from Microsoft Azure where their stack runs) / currently spending $3M/day!  </li>
<li>further/deeper work with Microsoft for a purpose-built AI stack using Azure, improving its AI performance and scalability..   </li>
<li>a safer play than going on their tiny own against Google &amp; Co.<br>
but most importantly I think:   </li>
<li>a shortcut to get from “hype product used by a niche” to “dominating AI on the largest share of business computers”, as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-will-it-take">How long will it take?</h2>
<p>Considering Microsoft's size, and the risks involved in deploying something too early to a mass of non-tech-savvy users, I would say a couple of years until we see a true impact. I might be (way) off though 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
