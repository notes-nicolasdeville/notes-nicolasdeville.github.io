<p>I love the product and have been using it for more than a year now (<span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/apps/grist" target="_blank">Grist | The Evolution of Spreadsheets</a></span>), so I was happy to oblige.   </p>
<p>Only now getting to do this write-up, but here it is:   </p>
<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-your-companys-name-what-kind-of-work-does-it-do">What is your company’s name? What kind of work does it do?</h2>
<p>I am now freelancing in B2B Sales, helping US B2B SaaS companies expand their business in Europe: https://BtoBSales.EU      </p>
<p>I was previously VP Sales &amp; MD EMEA (2x) of VC-backed US &amp; Australian SaaS startups which IPO'ed, and then bootstrapped 2x platform/SaaS startups which were acquired.    </p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-title-role-and-responsibilities">What is your title, role, and responsibilities?</h2>
<p>I'm the principal at BtoBSales.EU and sole employee - so I do everything, relying on freelancers for specific tasks (outsourcing data tasks is one of the many uses I have for Grist).  </p>
<h2 id="what-problem-were-you-trying-to-solve-when-you-set-out-looking-for-a-tool-like-grist">What problem were you trying to solve when you set out looking for a tool like Grist?</h2>
<p>Mainly lightweight data management combined with automations.   </p>
<h2 id="what-tools-were-you-using-what-was-the-former-process-and-its-pain-points">What tools were you using? What was the former process and its pain points?</h2>
<p>A few years ago, the startup we were building back then (in the private jet industry) combined both a platform compoment with a lot of data, and back-office automations for our members (eg automated invoice processing).  </p>
<p>I couldn't find a CTO for our bootstrapped startup.    </p>
<p>So I decided to start learning programming (quite late in life, aged 37), and build a platform and automations behind, with a combination of code, no-code and freelancers.  </p>
<p>I chose to learn Python as it was the most popular language for automation, and a pillar of AI which I had also intended to learn.  </p>
<p>For the first few years, when managing data that did not warrant spinning up a whole database on AWS (most of my needs), I used Excel files.  </p>
<p>I became quite proficient with manipulating Excel using Python, but it was still a pain to manage the data, files and lack of sharing. </p>
<p>The visual grid interface is a must for me (I'm visual) but I also wanted something more purpose-built than Excel.  </p>
<p>I tried a few solutions, but none really stuck.   </p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-find-grist-what-made-you-decide-on-grist">How did you find Grist? What made you decide on Grist?</h2>
<p>I can't remember how I found Grist - I think it might have been via ProductHunt, or one of the many apps newsletters/Reddits, etc.. I follow.   </p>
<p>When I came across Grist, it was a no-brainer to me as it seemed to combine everything I needed:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Excel-like interface &amp; logic</li>
<li>Database-like features</li>
<li>Sharing and collaboration</li>
<li>Custom views</li>
<li>Built-in backup &amp; versioning</li>
<li>most importantly: Python API (and Python logic underpinning everything actually)</li>
</ul>
<p>The one limitation I came across is the "document" size (equivalent to an Excel file, with tabs).<br>
For the few cases where I need a larger database, but still don't want to spin up a cloud database for it, I have started using local SQLite database files.   </p>
<h2 id="how-are-you-using-grist-now">How are you using Grist now?</h2>
<p>I have now many workspaces, and documents within each.    </p>
<p>I separate workspaces as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>one for each of my clients</li>
<li>one for my own company (<a href="https://devyer-ventures.com/" target="_blank">https://devyer-ventures.com/</a>)</li>
<li>one for my trading activities in B2B Sales (<a href="https://btobsales.eu/" target="_blank">https://btobsales.eu/</a>)</li>
<li>one for each of my personal projects (eg <a href="https://indexall.io/" target="_blank">https://indexall.io/</a>)</li>
<li>one for my personal site (<a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/" target="_blank">https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have many Python scripts &amp; automations that will run with Grist as the data backbone.  </p>
<p>My use cases are: </p>
<ul>
<li>mainly: for lightweight databases, and automation management.    </li>
<li>lightweight CRMs</li>
<li>timesheet management with freelancers</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, out of frustration with the existing emailing automation tools, I built my own (just based on Python scripts).   <br>
Grist is where I will have leads lists, along with the email campaigns management.     </p>
<p>You can see more here: <a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/projects/mailingee/" target="_blank">https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/projects/mailingee/</a>  </p>
<p>I'm also a big fan of lists in general 🤷🏻‍♂️   </p>
<p>For example, I'm putting together now the following lists, all using Grist as the data backbone:   </p>
<ul>
<li>VCs in SaaS &amp; AI (published at <a href="https://btobsales.eu/resources/directory-vcs" target="_blank">https://btobsales.eu/resources/directory-vcs</a>)  </li>
<li>Recruiters in Europe with a focus on Sales &amp; Executives (published at <a href="https://btobsales.eu/resources/directory-recruiters" target="_blank">https://btobsales.eu/resources/directory-recruiters</a>)   </li>
<li>virtual &amp; hybrid events companies (published at <a href="https://btobsales.eu/resources/directory-virtual-events-providers" target="_blank">https://btobsales.eu/resources/directory-virtual-events-providers</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these lists start with some data import to Grist using public sources. <br>
Data cleaning &amp; enrichment is done in Grist, using Python scripts. <br>
I will then keep adding to these lists in batches (if I come across a full list), or one by one - I have various scripts and keyboard shortcuts to add new entries quickly to Grist.   </p>
<p>I really like that I can configure my view, adding multiple tables as "widgets", to be able to see all records associated with a given master record.<br>
Here for example is a view combining 4 tables, with 3 of them being "widgets" (the 1st one is the master record upon which selection is based):    </p>
<p><img class="screenshot" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/vhucnsp9j1u/images/grist/221220-0930-grist-case-study.jpg" alt="grist/221220-0930-grist-case-study.jpg"/>  </p>
<p>I also use Grist as a custom-built lightweight CRM for my own activities with my clients - each seggregated in its own workspace. <br>
This allows me to control the data better across clients, from which I can generate custom reports and automations (including updating the client's CRM with the data they want to see).     </p>
<p>On the personal front, I manage for example my top movies list.  </p>
<p>See here for my project notes: <a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/projects/1000-movies/" target="_blank">https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/projects/1000-movies/</a>   <br>
and here for the published list: <a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/movies/1000/" target="_blank">https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/movies/1000/</a><br>
I do the same with books, apps and links I want to keep track of - all of which I publish using Python scripts fetching data from Grist and generating the needed HTML files.        </p>
<p>I don't do much outside of database-like use cases, but I will use Grist occasionally for other things, like for example timesheet management with freelancers.  </p>
<h2 id="do-you-work-in-a-team-and-if-so-how-many-team-members">Do you work in a team, and if so, how many team members?</h2>
<p>Only with freelancers.   </p>
<p>As mentioned, this is a good use case also for Grist: I can share a document with a freelancer, and they can work on it, without having to give them access to the whole Grist account.   </p>
<h2 id="how-has-grist-affected-youyour-teams-workflow-and-data-management">How has Grist affected you/your team's workflow and data management?</h2>
<p>Grist has become a staple of my data management &amp; automation workflows.   </p>
<p>I keep an open note here if anyone is interested: <span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/apps/grist" target="_blank">Grist | The Evolution of Spreadsheets</a></span>  </p>
