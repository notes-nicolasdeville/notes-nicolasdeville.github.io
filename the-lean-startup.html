<p>The concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">Lean Startup</a> - which originated from the book written by Eric Ries - is so pervasive in Startupland, and so ingrained in me, that I am always surprised to find plenty of new startup founders who have not heard of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because it's "old" (almost 10 years, so a lifetime in Tech - and some of its initial precepts have been contested and/or improved upon), or just because young founders have not heard of it yet.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's just me, and I just encountered the 1%.</p>
<p>In any case, thought I'd share here...</p>
<p>So Eric Ries wrote the book "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses-ebook/dp/B005PR422K/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0">The Lean Startup: How Constant Innovation Creates Radically Successful Businesses</a>" published in 2011, which is the foundation for the Lean Startup movement, and has become the defacto standard for building startups (and corporate innovation).</p>
<p>Beyond founders, I believe anyone in an innovation position within a large company, should also read the book and be aware of its precepts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelarias/">Miguel Arias</a>, now Global Entrepreneurship Director at Telefonica, recommended it to me in 2012 and I will always be grateful to him for that üôèüèº (I love great book recommendations!)</p>
<h2>It's the underlying precept that is of interest.</h2>
<p>It's a quick and easy read (read it all in one go on a flight between San Francisco and London). A good read. But not breathtaking.</p>
<p>And to be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed when I read it at first.</p>
<p>But after processing it (the tiredness and jetlag did not help I guess üòÖ), I realised that it broke the common understanding that a business is built on the back of a clear and long-term business model (including precise financials and what the company will do).</p>
<p>Startups are messy. Risky.</p>
<p>The commonly accepted definition of a startup, which originated from Steve Blank (the "Godfather of Startups".. or "of Silicon Valley"? ü§î Can't remember... anyway, he's legit üòÅ) is "a temporary organisation, searching for a repeatable, scalable and profitable business model".</p>
<p>So a startup <em>precedes</em> the business model.</p>
<p>If you have a business model, it means you are building a traditional business - a bakery, a restaurant, etc... and that's fine.</p>
<p>But startups are <em>searching</em> for a business and its associated business model.</p>
<p>It's an exploratory endeavour.  </p>
<p>And that search can take a scientific form.</p>
<p>Just like in scientific research, you formulate a hypothesis (an idea), you define the experiments to test that hypothesis, and you learn from the results of the experiment.</p>
<p>Contrary to scientific research though, the successful output is not a paper (a "scientific report") earning its credentials by being peer-reviewed (ie approved by qualified 3rd parties), but a business earning its credentials by having user adoption, and ultimately making money.</p>
<h2>The actionable insights</h2>
<p>In startup terms, the steps to follow are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify a pain to solve* (most critical aspect for rapid adoption)</li>
<li><strong>Build</strong> a MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</li>
<li>Use the MVP to test your assumptions (hypothesis)</li>
<li><strong>Measure</strong> your tests</li>
<li><strong>Learn</strong> from each (small) test</li>
<li>Iterate on your hypothesis</li>
</ol>
<p>Rinse and repeat until you hit gold üòÅ</p>
<p>"MVP" is now a common term. Here is in a short graphic what building a MVP and iterating looks like:</p>
<p>mvp<em>(the faces represent the users, in case you wonder)</em></p>
<p>"Build, Measure, Learn" is the mantra of startups following the Lean Startup principles.</p>
<p>Though do not let me spoil everything.</p>
<p>There is more to it, and learnings happen really only when part of a story or larger context.</p>
<p>So if you haven't read it, and you are currently or plan to build a startup, I highly recommend you to read Lean Startup.</p>

<p>Have you read the Lean Startup? How did you find it? Has it helped you?  </p>
<p>I'm very interested to hear if you have examples where the precepts failed for you, and learnings you extracted from it?</p>
<p>Comment below ü§ó</p>
<hr>
<p>* in the case of my 2nd startup, I decided (knowing, but underestimating the challenge), to go full Lean Startup, but without focusing on a particular problem to solve (one key criteria to make it work). It's definitely harder! You can read more here if curious:</p>
