<div class="wip"><div class="wip_text">👷🏼‍♂️ WORK IN PROGRESS 👷🏼‍♂️</div></div>

<p>The character Elon Musk and the developments in his companies have fascinated me for over a decade now.   </p>
<p>This includes:    </p>
<ol>
<li>Zip2/x.com/Paypal (past)</li>
<li>Tesla</li>
<li>SpaceX</li>
<li>The Boring Company</li>
<li>Neuralink</li>
<li>OpenAI (past)</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
</ol>
<p>To be specific, I have followed Elon Musk closely (sounds creepy, I know! 😂) since Steve Jobs' death in 2011.   </p>
<h2 id="it-all-started-with-steve-jobs">it all started with Steve Jobs</h2>
<p>I was similarly fascinated by Steve Jobs, starting in 2007.    </p>
<p>My fascination with Jobs was triggered by a personal experience.       </p>
<h3 id="competing-against-the-iphone-before-it-came-out">competing against the iPhone.. before it came out!</h3>
<p>At the time, I was working at a French manufacturer of telecommunications equipment for consumers, or CPE in the jargon.       </p>
<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">"In telecommunications, a customer-premises equipment or customer-provided equipment (CPE) is any terminal and associated equipment located at a subscriber's premises and connected with a carrier's telecommunication circuit".</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">Wikipedia</div></div>

<p>The products we sold ranged from fax machines to residential &amp; mobile phones. The company was obviously trying to be ahead with technology, and pioneer new CPEs.  <br>
I was an Account Manager, in charge of the largest telcos in Europe.   </p>
<p>In 2006 I sold <strong>the concept</strong> of a "home tablet" with touch screen to the largest European telco. Well.. WE sold, as it was with a team of course - but in that particular case, one of my proudest achievement, I'm venturing in the frowned upon use of "I sold".      <br>
What I mean here by "selling the concept" is that the product did not exist. It was only slides and a non-working mockup.  <br>
And we got a multi million purchase order to trigger its development.    </p>
<p>After selling it to one telco, my CEO pushed me to sell the same concept to a 2nd telco - to validate the interest, and mitigate development risks.   </p>
<p>After gaining buy-in from most within that 2nd telco, I landed in a meeting with a high-ranking exec at that company, and my own CEO.   </p>
<p>The main challenge we had at the time with the mockup we brought with us was the touch screen. More precisely the user experience with it wasn't good - lagging and not smooth.   </p>
<p>Seeing this, the exec stopped and told us something along the lines of "guys, hold on... this will not work.. let me show you the future.".  </p>
<p>And he proceeded to take out from his vest pocket a slick black slate. And he demonstrated to us this new phone, not out yet (we were under NDA), with its silky smooth touch screen scrolling.  </p>
<p>My heart skipped a beat, and I was in awe.   </p>
<p>This was the iPhone.   </p>
<p>We managed to close the deal on the promise that we'd improve our touch screen to this new phone's level.   </p>
<p>And I started to look into Apple with more curiosity, as they would be a competitor now, rather than just a computer company.   </p>
<p>My obession with Steve Jobs had started.    </p>
<h2 id="the-next-steve-jobs">the next Steve Jobs</h2>
<p>When Steve Jobs died, I wondered who "the next Steve Jobs" would be - it was so sad to me that the world had lost a visionary that was making the world more exciting to live in.   </p>
<p>Almost immediately, in Dec 2011, I came across Elon Musk for the first time.   </p>
<h2 id="what-following-means">what "following" means</h2>
<p>I have spent more time than I would care to admit over the last 15 years to study them both.    </p>
<p>The scope of this "following" includes:   </p>
<ul>
<li>specialist websites (dedicated to Apple, Tesla, SpaceX, etc..)</li>
<li>following specific Twitter users</li>
<li>newsletters </li>
<li>their respective companies' presentations (eg. keynotes &amp; product launches, quarterly earnings, etc..)</li>
<li>YouTube channels (last 5 years only.. but <em>a lot</em> of videos!)</li>
<li>long-form video interviews (all I could find)</li>
<li>books (eg Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs or Ashley Vance's biography of Elon Musk)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: while I can relate and "connect" with their way of thinking and seeing the world, I would not want to be them.  <br>
It is not out of a bizarre frustration of not being them.  <br>
The life sacrifices required to build businesses (and personas) of that scale are outside of my life priorities and what I see as sucess - primarly family.   </p>
<p>It remains fascinating to me though to observe and analyse these 2 characters.     </p>
<h2 id="jobs-vs-musk">Jobs vs Musk</h2>
<p>They are both bending reality to their will following their singular &amp; exciting visions.   </p>
<p>There are lots of similarities between both - yet at the same time they are so different.   </p>
<p>Jobs combined a hippie culture with technological vision, fuelled by a LSD trip(s) and focusing on how humans &amp; computers can "connect".   <br>
His genius was in creating great products with insane attention to details, and state-of-the art marketing behind. <br>
His keynotes (ie product launches) were famous - slick &amp; exciting. Books have been written about them and I've studied the method behind this extraordinary level of professionalism.   </p>
<p>Elon has "out of this world" visions, is fearless, and operating from first principles to rethink what people think is "impossible".  <br>
He is not neurotypical (ie autistic - Asperger's syndrome) which explains why he comes across as weird to most.  <br>
The first time I saw Elon presenting I was shocked. Especially after years of studying the polishness (?) of Apple's presentations, rehearsed to death.  <br>
Elon stutters, digresses, looks unprepared - like he's winging it live.  <br>
But listening to him, my mind was blown by the grandeur of his vision - eg "making the human species interplanetary" (aka "going to Mars") is like a dream for any science-fiction fan like me - and his (technical) knowledge (uncommon for typical CEOs).    </p>
<p>I'm happy they both exist(ed). </p>
<h2 id="its-all-about-great-products">it's all about great products</h2>
<p>And I LOVE their products.</p>
<p>I'm lucky to be able to afford most of their companies' portfolio products.   </p>
<p>I live in an Apple &amp; Tesla/Starlink ecosystem, with a deep experience of their products.   </p>
<p>Both can be accused of putting form over function at times.   </p>
<p>But the feeling you get when using their products is vastly superior (to me) compared with other similar products.   </p>
<p>And a great product sells itself.    </p>

<h3 id="message-to-detractors">message to detractors</h3>
<p>Is Elon Musk perfect?   </p>
<p>Yes, of course,   </p>
<p>You are right!   </p>
<p>He isn't.   </p>
<p>Nobody is 🤷🏻‍♂️    </p>
<p>But he's trying, harder than most, to improve the world we live in, and beyond.     </p>
<p>His track record so far is net positive so.. perhaps we can give him some slack?    </p>
<p>If everyone had experience building a business - especially one considered "impossible" - and the pains &amp; hard decisions that come with it, there would be less negativity and more understanding/support.   </p>
<p>The issues mainly are with his communication:</p>
<p>1) he is not neurotypical (Asperger's syndrome, aka "autistic"), so communicates differently than most (less filter).
2) his public comms = his bullish internal goal-setting. Very atypical in the business world (more common in early stage startups).
3) he works on things that have never been done before. Considering building a house (done millions of time) comes usually over time and over budget, of course delivering on the "impossible" will not happen on the day - who cares in the long run?
4) his work bandwidth &amp; cross-functional knowledge are phenomenal - I think "Elon time" is basically thinking "how long would it take for a team of people like me to deliver on that" + he doesn't know everything + </p>
<p>Is he making mistakes along the way?</p>
<p>Sure he is.</p>
<p>Who wouldn't?</p>
<p>But it's about focusing on intent. </p>
<h2 id="social-media-answers">Social media answers</h2>
<p><span class="datestamp">19 Nov 2022</span> </p>
<p>I for one, if I'd be in that position, would welcome going "extremely hardcore". </p>
<p>I think working with Elon in the early days of a venture (eg x.com 2.0 here) OR saving a venture from near bankruptcy (also the case here) is like joining the NAVY Seals. Not for the faint of heart. </p>
<p>Plenty of room in the regular army (ie other Tech companies) for great people not aligned with this though. </p>
<p>That's basically his message.</p>
<p>Elon's MO is to have a small team of dedicated people: I read that Tesla's AI team is only 150 (and arguably dominates the market) vs 1000s at other companies.</p>
<p>Let's see if this bet here will work as well as it has with others 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<p>Also: plenty of similar comments about Steve Jobs' leadership style at the time - yet 20 years later Apple dominates and Jobs is hailed as a visionary genius. </p>
