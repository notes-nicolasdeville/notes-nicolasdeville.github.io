<p>Youtube is obviously a great resource to learn a lot of things. Or just binge on whatever your version of cat videos is.</p>
<p>I use it mainly for deep diving into topics (from AI to archery) and watching keynotes &amp; conference talks ðŸ¤“</p>
<p>When I see a Youtube video that looks interesting though, most times I will simply download it for later viewing, rather than interrupt my flow and take my focus away.</p>
<p>For that, I have been using <a href="https://www.4kdownload.com/products/product-videodownloader">4K Video Downloader</a> for a long time now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.4kdownload.com/products/product-videodownloader">4K Video Downloader | Free Video Downloader for PÐ¡, macOS and LinuxThe simplest video downloader, ever! Download video and audio from YouTube and similar services on macOS, PC and Linux absolutely for free!<img alt="" src="https://static.4kdownload.com/main/img/apple-touch-icon-114x114.6461ee2446c6.png">4K DownloadOpen Media LLC<img alt="" src="https://static.4kdownload.com/main/img/product/videodownloader/share.5ce9e84235fc.jpg"></a>### Download in 2 clicks</p>
<p>I just copy the link to the video, click one button in 4KVD, and the video will download, and be added to my iTunes, syncing with my iPhone.</p>
<p>So with 2 clicks, I add videos to my local library, which I can watch on any device - phone, computer or TV (I catch up sometimes on these videos in the evening, on my AppleTV)</p>
<p>It works with entire channels too! Here is a quick demo:</p>
<h3>Automated Youtube channels download</h3>
<p>Though I am not using this feature (because it means having a YouTube account and donating my privacy in exchange ðŸ¤“), if you have a Youtube account and you are subscribed to channels, you can have them download automatically (in your iTunes library if you wish so).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/2020/02/Image-2020-02-16-at-10.46.14-pm.png">### Helpful for meeting preparations</p>
<p>For example the other day, I had a consulting engagement for which I needed to travel by train.</p>
<p>This engagement required me to understand a business software I had never used before.</p>
<p>Before I left, with 2 clicks, I downloaded the entire Youtube channel of the software vendor - 30+ videos.</p>
<p>And watched them offline in the train on my way.</p>
<p>It also works with other sites which have videos embedded.</p>
<h2><img alt="" src="images/2020/02/Image-2020-02-16-at-6.54.38-pm.png">Settings</h2>
<p>I always like to start getting to know a new app, by looking as the available settings (Preferences in macOS). Here they are:</p>
<h2><img alt="" src="images/2020/02/Image-2020-02-16-at-6.55.12-pm.png">All major setting here. And the ability to connect your Youtube account - if you have one - for automated downloads.<img alt="" src="images/2020/02/Image-2020-02-16-at-6.55.19-pm.png">If you have limited bandwidth, you can cap how much 4KVD will use.<img alt="" src="images/2020/02/Image-2020-02-16-at-6.55.25-pm.png"><img alt="" src="images/2020/02/Image-2020-02-16-at-6.55.39-pm.png">Behind the 1-click download, lies a setting, where you can define your output preferences.Freemium</h2>
<p>The free version allows you to download only single videos, and shows ads.</p>
<p>An upgrade to Premium is $/â‚¬15 - as one time fee (rare these days!) for 3 computers - removing the ads, and enabling you to download playlists.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/2020/02/4k_pricing.png">It's definitely a very useful tool in my toolbox!</p>
<p>Hope 4KVD helps you make the best of what YouTube has to offer like it has for me all these years.</p>
<p>Are you using a different (and better) video downloader?</p>
