<p>What is it that makes someone a good leader? Their charisma, or their internal drive perhaps?</p>
<p>Could it be that the great leaders are the ones that see a picture that is broader in its view than everyone else?</p>
<p>Whatever it is, it causes people to want to attach, follow, and collaborate with the great leaders of our generation.</p>
<p>Like a moth to a flame, individuals are attracted to the person and the cause. Often with a desire to participate or get involved in some way.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, for example, have each created a following that is almost cult-like in its dedication.</p>
<p>It did not happen overnight.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos started Amazon from his garage. Before Tesla, Elon Musk got his start founding a company called X.com, which later became PayPal.</p>
<p>Creating the biggest online retailer and a $1 billion dollar car company takes a massive amount of determination and application.</p>
<p>Both Jeff and Elon have an insatiable drive for delivering the right products to the right customers and have built empires on that concept.</p>
<p>How did they achieve it? By working hard and pushing their teams to achieve higher success.</p>
<p>Leaders are not known for subtlety when it comes to interacting with their teams. Their primary focus is providing excellent service and delivering what the customer wants, at any price.</p>
<p>Like a north star, they set a goal and drive teams toward it. Generating a combined effort that can achieve great things, or occasionally push people beyond their capabilities or comfort zone.</p>
<p>Great leaders get people on board and drive them towards their vision of success.</p>
<p>This laser-targeted, customer-driven mentality can cause some employee turnover, but it is all viewed as being for the greater good.</p>
<p>“You know who you are, you don’t know who you may be” – Jay Z</p>
<p>The bigger the vision of a leader, the more likely it is that (s)he will not be a good manager.</p>
<p>You cannot invent humanity-defining products like iPhone, Amazon, electric vehicles and offer a comfortable environment to employees.</p>
<p>The 2 just don’t mix.</p>
<p>Pushing the limits in order to achieve an "impossible" vision, means pushing the limits of what people believe they can do.</p>
<p>It means going beyond what is safe or known.</p>
<h2>Leadership vs management</h2>
<p>Good leaders can sometimes make bad managers. Good managers often do not make great leaders.</p>
<p>I have worked with both and have found that the best leaders blend a combination of both management and leadership skills.</p>
<p>So, what makes a good manager? They differ from leaders in that they are primarily focussed on the individual wants and needs of their people.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we can say that:</p>
<p>Leaders = vision &amp; customer oriented</p>
<p>Managers = team oriented</p>
<p>Leaders = have people follow them</p>
<p>Managers= have people work for them</p>
<p>Good managers can adapt quickly to changing situations and direct their employees to respond quickly to new events or requirements.</p>
<p>They protect their people and strive to advance them in their career goals.</p>
<p>There are many different management styles which can be interchangeable depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Autocratic, Democratic, Transactional, Servant, Laissez-faire, coaching, visionary, are all management styles that can be observed.</p>
<p>Some work better than others but all have their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Identify those around you as leaders or managers then watch how they operate.</p>
<p>What is their style?</p>
<p>What do they do well?</p>
<p>What are their strengths and weaknesses?</p>
<p>What could they improve or do differently?</p>
<p>By observing and making honest assessments you will be able to learn what works best, and what not to do. Find your own style.</p>
<h2>Managers and Imposter Syndrome</h2>
<p>That said, all management or leadership styles can be subjective. The ‘best’ can be a fluid concept. What works for one may not work for another.</p>
<p>Some employees work well under tough demands and rise to the occasion, some do not and can buckle under pressure.</p>
<p>This is true also of managers and leaders. Did you know that many suffer from Imposter Syndrome?</p>
<p>You can read more about how I suffered from it every step of my own journey "climbing up the ladder":</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/careerplaybook-002-imposter-syndrome-is-more-widespread-than-you-think/">#CareerPlaybook 002: Imposter syndrome is more widespread than you thinkI come across as confident, yet I had imposter syndrome every step of the way in my career. I’m thankful for it.<img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/favicon.png">Nicolas DevilleNicolas Deville<img alt="" src="images/2020/02/CP002_blog.64221d60d58a4a5a8e60613010481a96.svg"></a>The feeling of not being truly deserving of their position or accolades, that advancement was caused by chance rather than being earned.</p>
<p>Even if this is the case, faking it until you make it is a valid strategy to adopt, and it is a tactic that is used by some.</p>
<p>Some leaders use these acting skills so well that no-one would ever know the truth.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because perception is reality.</p>
<p>And good leaders/managers will learn quickly what they need to bridge the gap between the "faking it", and the "knowing it".</p>
<p>In any case, following someone that knows what they are doing, or at least seems to, can bring benefits.</p>
<p>It can provide great insights into what strategies and methods work well and yield results.</p>
<p>This may then be used in your own work methodology.</p>
<p>When adopting your own management or leadership style is important to assess what works best for you.</p>
<p>Just because you may admire someone that uses a specific style it may not best serve your purposes and own style.</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself and adopt the strategies that bring you the best results. Your style will always differ from someone else’s.</p>
<p>Being a business owner often means that you must be both a leader and a manager in varying quantities.</p>
<p>There are times that require leadership, and times that require management. Knowing the difference between the two is an art that takes practice.</p>
<p>The challenge is to align your employees or teams with your beliefs, goals, and vision to provide the best possible service.</p>
<p>Leading a team as well as managing a day-to-day operation is a delicate balancing act. Being able to juggle both successfully will create a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>If structured correctly, it will permeate your entire organisation and can lead to greater success.</p>
