<p>There is a famous saying:</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúOne who never asks questions either knows everything or nothing.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>This is very true. And the likelihood that you know everything is very slim üòÅ</p>
<p>There are no dumb questions and you should never be afraid or embarrassed to ask for confirmation or clarification on a subject.</p>
<p>In fact, asking good questions can be a positive thing. </p>
<p>It can generate trust, especially among intelligent people, when you ask good questions. </p>
<p>Even those at C-level and higher will appreciate questions being asked.</p>
<p>Why? Because they know it is better to be clear, and have an understanding of the subject at hand.</p>
<p>Too often, not asking questions can lead to mistakes and misunderstandings, all because someone was too self conscious, or shy, to speak up.</p>
<p>The fear of coming across like an imbecile often prevents people asking questions. But in my experience I have found that people <em>like</em> to be asked questions, they <em>appreciate</em> it.</p>
<p>Good questions can sell you. </p>
<p>People are usually happy to answer questions, it directs the focus of the conversation to them, and generally, people like talking about themselves.</p>
<p>Asking good questions can reflect well on you.</p>
<p>It shows you are interested and conveys your understanding of the subject being discussed. </p>
<p>Good questions can spark insight in the person you are asking them to; making them reflect on the topic and think it through. Possibly from an angle they have not considered before. </p>
<p>Challenging questions, which can push people out of their comfort zone at first, are usually appreciated, even if it is in hindsight (like good wine, they get better with time - though I would not know because I do not drink alcohol üòÅ).</p>
<p>While asking questions can be a positive thing, there is a balance that needs to be maintained. Be careful in your tone of questioning, you do not want to sound (too) critical of the proposition or plan.</p>
<p>Asking questions that are too abrupt or uncomfortable may annoy or alienate the person you are talking to, which does not create a positive rapport.</p>
<p>For me, asking good questions is a pillar of Sales.</p>
<p>Making sure that you fully understand your prospects wants, needs, and their concerns, creates <em>value</em> in their eyes. </p>
<p>Fully comprehending what they hope to achieve will help you in planning and executing a sales strategy.</p>
<p>Place yourself squarely in their shoes and ask questions that help you paint a mental image of them and their goals. </p>
<p>Try and envision their struggles and their trials, what their challenges may be, and attempt to ascertain their motivations. </p>
<p>If you were them, ask what you would want to see and hear to make you commit to a sale or contract? </p>
<p>What actions would you want to see, or questions would you want to hear if you were the client?</p>
<p>Being able to see in this way and ask questions in this manner avoids making incorrect assumptions. It helps you to see the world through their eyes.</p>

<p>You do not have to be the same shoe size to put yourself in their shoes, but being able to understand their mindset and perspective is beneficial.</p>
<p>It will help you to form a bond with your client that, over time, can lead to a better and more productive business relationship.</p>
