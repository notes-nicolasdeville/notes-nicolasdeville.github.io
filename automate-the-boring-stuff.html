<h2>It's never too late</h2>
<p>While I'm tech-savvy, an overall geek, have tinkered with computers, and been working in Technology for the last 20 years, I never thought before a few years ago about learning to program, because it seemed "out of reach".</p>
<p>For some reason, I held to the perception that programming requires you to be good at advanced mathematics, and requires years of full-time practice ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<p>Aged 37 (it's never too late!) and triggered by a critical need, I came round to diving into it because I could not find a Tech co-founder for my 1st startup, and decided to do it myself. More here:</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/startupplaybook-01-how-to-bootstrap-a-tech-startup/">How to bootstrap a Tech startup without a Tech cofounderI wish someone had told me earlier that programming, and building tech solutions, is not that hard to learn, especially with tools available these days, and for the purpose of a MVP or early stage startup.<img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/favicon.png">Nicolas DevilleNicolas Deville<img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/02/SP01_blog-4.svg"></a>And realised I should have done that two decades ago! üôÑ</p>
<p>Truth is, programming is just another language. It's computer language.</p>
<p>And contrary to human languages, it's extremely logical (contrary to say, French grammar! üá´üá∑üòÖ).</p>
<p>All you need is good logic - better if innate, though learning to program will also help you think more logically and in a structured way - and perseverance.</p>
<p>I decided to learn <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
<p>It was described as an easy to learn language, extremely popular and gaining even more, and the primary language for all things AI and Machine Learning, which is a topic I'm passionate about.</p>
<p>In that journey of learning how to program - which has led me to build a startup heavily relying on automation, and my current startup, <a href="https://OfficeBots.io">OfficeBots.io</a>, focusing entirely on it - this one book has made all the difference for me.</p>
<h2>Perfect starting point for business people</h2>
<p>Most books and online courses about learning Python (or other programming languages) focus on the language itself, and in most cases will use the creation of a basic video game ü§ì to illustrate the learnings.</p>
<p>The 1st book I read about Python (for beginners) felt like I was reading chinese! Though I could read the words, so not quite that bad.. but I understood perhaps 10% of it üòÖ</p>
<p>The 2nd book was similar, though I understood a bit more.</p>
<p>With Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, everything clicked for me. üí°</p>
<p>Because the book is written with a background of automating things with commonly used office files - PDF, Excel, Word, etc..</p>
<p>The use cases made so much sense, and provided the context for me to relate the theory of the language, with its real-life applications.</p>
<p>It "blew my mind" as my mind started to race, thinking about all the potential applications.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>In my case, here are some applications I developed - with help from freelancers to troubleshoot, clean up my code (or redo it!):</p>
<h3>Automated invoice processing</h3>
<p>Supplier sends PDF invoice to dedicated email address. A bot written in Python, extracts the data, checks a couple things, flags to a human if needed, and provides the data in a format that can be ingested by our system, and that of our client (accounting system or CFRM).</p>
<h3>Price engine &amp; custom report generator.</h3>
<p>Fetches data from various sources (e.g. in-house CRM database, in-house flight records database) to generate custom internal or external reports in XLSX format.</p>
<h3>Data fetching</h3>
<p>Daily login to a portal, download of a CSV file and parsing data into our database.</p>
<h3>Hyper-personalised spam-safe emailing</h3>
<p>Send hyper-personalised emails at scale, sent directly from the actual local email client (no difference with a manually written and sent email, so no more risk to be caught in spam filters).</p>
<h3>Email finder</h3>
<p>Find email addresses at scale with just first name, last name and company website (from excel list).</p>
<h3>KPI Slackbot</h3>
<p>Slackbot publishing daily metrics, with data fetched across various systems (e.g. in-house CRM, Dropbox, etc..).</p>
<h3>Various scripts</h3>
<p>Along with a flurry of useful scripts for my day-to-day, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>splits PDFs with many pages into single page PDF files.</li>
<li>Custom URL shortener (Slackbot).</li>
<li>Formatting of Excel spreadsheets (so database exports look professional when sending to clients).</li>
<li>Happy password generator</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>I credit Automate the Boring Stuff with Python for being the seed that has helped me come up and build all of these.</p>
<p>And you can get help from freelancers, when you get stuck, or know what needs to be done, but lack the time to do it yourself. More here:</p>

Low-value tasks should be delegated.

<p>Here is an overview of its chapters, to give you a better sense of its content:</p>
<p>Chapter 0 ‚Äì Introduction</p>
<p>Chapter 1 ‚Äì Python Basics</p>
<p>Chapter 2 ‚Äì Flow Control</p>
<p>Chapter 3 ‚Äì Functions</p>
<p>Chapter 4 ‚Äì Lists</p>
<p>Chapter 5 ‚Äì Dictionaries and Structuring Data</p>
<p>Chapter 6 ‚Äì Manipulating Strings</p>
<p>Chapter 7 ‚Äì Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions</p>
<p>Chapter 8 ‚Äì Input Validation</p>
<p>Chapter 9 ‚Äì Reading and Writing Files</p>
<p>Chapter 10 ‚Äì Organising Files</p>
<p>Chapter 11 ‚Äì Debugging</p>
<p>Chapter 12 ‚Äì Web Scraping</p>
<p>Chapter 13 ‚Äì Working with Excel Spreadsheets</p>
<p>Chapter 14 ‚Äì Working with Google Spreadsheets</p>
<p>Chapter 15 ‚Äì Working with PDF and Word Documents</p>
<p>Chapter 16 ‚Äì Working with CSV Files and JSON Data</p>
<p>Chapter 17 ‚Äì Keeping Time, Scheduling Tasks, and Launching Programs</p>
<p>Chapter 18 ‚Äì Sending Email and Text Messages</p>
<p>Chapter 19 ‚Äì Manipulating Images</p>
<p>Chapter 20 ‚Äì Controlling the Keyboard and Mouse with GUI Automation</p>
<p>Appendix A ‚Äì Installing Third-Party Modules</p>
<p>Appendix B ‚Äì Running Programs</p>
<p>Appendix C ‚Äì Answers to the Practice Questions</p>
<p>As you can see, if you come at it from a business background, what you learn in chapters 1 to 11, will then completely make sense in chapters 12 to 20, as it puts the theory in the context of things you probably do on a daily basis.</p>
