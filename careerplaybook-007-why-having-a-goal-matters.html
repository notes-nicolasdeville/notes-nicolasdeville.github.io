<p>Who has not ever dreaded the ‚Äúwhere do you see yourself in 5 years‚Äù question during an interview?</p>
<p>I cannot say I had a good answer to that question early in my career.</p>
<p>As I grew into leadership positions though, I understood more and more the need to have a clear long-term goal. One that needs to be articulated clearly to the team.</p>
<p>It helps ensure everyone knows the course, and can be empowered to make the appropriate decisions on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Without a goal, you are just at the mercy of your environment. In reactive mode.</p>
<p>On a boat, you might reach an island by wandering aimlessly, but aiming for one is much more efficient.</p>
<p>The same applies to one‚Äôs career.</p>
<p>You can just cruise along in your job, and after years decide to move on (or the decision is made for you üò®) and search for your new opportunity.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs best to set yourself a long-term goal - it will help make decisions as you go. See opportunities for you to learn and grow, that will take you closer to that goal. Opportunities you might not see otherwise.</p>
<p>Perhaps the long-term goal you have includes getting a promotion in your current company. The Jerry Maguire play could unlock it for you (see <a href="careerplaybook-004-the-jerry-maguire-play.html">#CareerPlaybook 004</a>.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who do you want to be in 5, 10 or 20 years‚Äô time?</li>
<li>What would you like to be doing then?</li>
<li>How do you want to feel then?</li>
<li>What kind of money are you aiming to have?</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the answers, shape your goal, and make it your north star.</p>
<p>You might not get there exactly, but you will maximise your chances of doing so, by having a clear long-term goal in your mind.</p>
<p>Now, ‚Äúeveryone has a plan, until they get punched in the face‚Äù, as Mike Tyson famously said. But having one, is better than having none I find. When I get punched, by life, I just readjust the plan.</p>
<p>PS: don‚Äôt beat yourself up if you cannot (yet) figure out your long-term plan. Especially in your 20s. Optimise for learning and personal growth, and see opportunities to do so.</p>
