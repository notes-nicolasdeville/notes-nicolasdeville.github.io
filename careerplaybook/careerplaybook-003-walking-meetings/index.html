<p>I mentioned this in a podcast interview I did recently, and to a couple fresh sales leaders I am mentoring. And I was surprised that this was a major take-away for them - so thought I would share more about it here.</p>
<p>As I grew into leadership roles, I realised how much time I spent in one-to-ones.</p>
<p>I also realised that meeting someone within the confines of a meeting room, makes the exchange "stiffer" than it should.</p>
<p>When the goal is to have a deep discussion, especially about someone (their drivers, fears, ambitions, etc), this can be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Of course, the usual alternative is a "coffee meeting" - already better. Though it comes with consumption - bad for your wallet, and your health sometimes (a juice is probably better than your 3rd pumpkin spice latte of the day).</p>
<p>And in any case, sitting down face-to-face means there is more (unconscious) focus on how to behave - body and face expression while facing the other - especially when there is a hierarchical relationship to the two participants.</p>
<p>Plus silences - to think and reflect on a question or topic - are "heavier" when sitting down face-to-face.</p>
<p>A walking meeting is ideal with someone working in your team (eg 1-to-1), a candidate, or simply with a colleague.</p>
<p>It can be just around the block, or in a more pleasant environment. I loved doing some along the Thames river, though I have done many more simply walking the (quieter) streets of London.</p>
<h2 id="fosters-openness">Fosters openness</h2>
<p>In my experience, walking meetings help reduce the barriers.</p>
<p>People talk more openly, share more. Perhaps due to a combination of fresh air, being in the open (feeling less vulnerable), and not looking directly at each other.</p>
<p>It helps go "deeper" into one's understanding of the other.</p>
<p>And silences feel more natural when walking.</p>
<p>When assessing a candidate, it provides a more human insight into her/him - the mask drops off (a bit).</p>
<p>It's also a much nicer way to deliver and discuss bad news - like having to let someone go - or addressing and working out problems - like when a team member is on the path to it.</p>
<p>The focus is more on the discussion, the content, rather than on "how to behave".</p>
<h2 id="engine-for-creative-thinking">Engine for creative thinking</h2>
<p>Beyond my experience, it is also scientifically proven, that humans think better, and creatively, when walking:</p>
<p><a href="https://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/walking-and-creativity" target="_blank">How Does the Brain-Body Connection Affect Creativity?</a></p>
<p>"In three of the alternate uses studies the numbers were profound: 81%, 88%, and 100% of participants were more creative walking than sitting"</p>
<p>For innovation discussions, clarifying the mind(s) or solving problems collaboratively, walking together is something I highly recommend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All truly great thoughts are conceived by walking”<br>
— Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was quite extreme though, saying "Only ideas won by walking have any value." - I would not go as far though. Showers and baths are great for me too... but probably not something you want to picture me in nore something you'd want to do a meeting in!</p>
<p>If you're a TED talk fan, here is one for you: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nilofer_merchant_got_a_meeting_take_a_walk" target="_blank">"Got a meeting? Take a walk"</a></p>
<p>So Freud, Aristotle, Truman and Dickens were also known for using long walks to foster their thinking.</p>
<p>And Steve Jobs famously relied a lot on walking meetings. Which is perhaps where I took my inspiration to do these in the first place, though I can't remember exactly - decisions are usually a mashup of various inputs and a process, rather than the consequence of a single input.</p>
<h2 id="a-healthy-habit">A healthy habit</h2>
<p>Walking meetings will also help you achieve your 10,000 daily steps - contributing to keeping you healthy.</p>
<p>It exposed you to fresh air - which we are all lacking in our office jobs. At least as fresh as city air can be!</p>
<p>There is really no downside, in my eyes, to do meetings while walking. At least when it's only 2-3 people involved.</p>
<p>So if you need to have a deep discussion, where openness is critical, or foster a creative discussion, be it personal or business, ditch the office and have a walking meeting.</p>
