<p>Thank You. Just 2 simple little words. But they have immense power.</p>
<p>Power to express gratitude, transform situations from negative to positive, or convey appreciation.</p>
<p>They have the power to heal, show forgiveness, and express understanding.</p>
<p>The power of Thank You has long been recognised by health professionals as having several benefits associated with it.</p>
<p>It is a proven fact that living in a state of gratitude has a favourable impact. It lowers blood pressure, reduces stress, and improves overall well-being.</p>
<p>People that dwell in the positive maintain better friendships, enjoy more career success, and have more fulfilling marriages.</p>
<p>All from using those 2 little words.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you-in-the-real-world">Thank You in the real world</h2>
<p>While that is all good news, I have found that in reality we simply don’t say ‘Thank You’ nearly as much as we should.</p>
<p>Or it is mumbled by people as a reflex response without any real <em>meaning</em> behind it. I was guilty of that a lot - and sometimes still am.</p>
<p>Recognition and appreciation can move mountains and drive people to achieving great things. So, saying Thank You in abundance can bring real rewards.</p>
<p>The absence of appreciation has the direct opposite effect. It demotivates, devalues, and can create incredible frustration to those that require that recognition.</p>
<p>Looking someone in the eye, saying ‘Thank You’ sincerely and authentically is extremely impactful.</p>
<p>I have learned that saying Thank You often can bring benefits to many situations, personal as well as business.</p>
<p>Thank You is probably one of the most underused phrases in the world. It takes a second to say it and it can be applied in almost any situation.</p>
<p>· Thank You can be used when receiving a compliment</p>
<p>· Thank You can be used when receiving bad news “Thank You for sharing, I know this a hard time right now”</p>
<p>· Thank You can be used when receiving feedback or constructive criticism as an alternative to responding defensively.</p>
<p>· Thank You can be used when receiving advice - even if it is unsolicited.</p>
<p>· Thank You can be used to apologise for something. “Sorry I’m late. Thank You for your patience”</p>
<p>Thank You can be used in almost any interaction, and if you are not sure that you should say Thank You, say it anyway.</p>
<p>No-one is going to be cross because you showed them gratitude.</p>
<p>My advice? Say Thank You more, say it often, say it meaningfully.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you-in-business-environments">Thank you in business environments</h2>
<p>Companies all over the world, big and small know that ‘Thank You’ goes a long way to impacting the bottom line.</p>
<p>A trick I learned from Ben Sullivan, one of my mentors, is to capitalise the T and Y in Thank You when writing the phrase (which you might have noticed here).</p>
<p>It makes the 'You' stand out to the readers and places increased emphasis and meaning on the thanks given.</p>
<p>Extending thanks to customers and employees has become standard business practice within many organisations.</p>
<p>I recently read that a large company introduced a ‘thanking’ session’ at the start of their board meetings.</p>
<p>Employees praised each other for tasks and accomplishments before discussing any other business.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>· Because ‘Thank You’ is extremely powerful.</p>
<p>· Because it creates a positive mindset before tackling the issues of the day.</p>
<p>· Because as human beings we crave that recognition and respond to it.</p>
<p>Warren Buffet famously said “Praise what you want, value what you get.”</p>
<p>He knew what he was talking about.</p>
<p>In a business environment the power of Thank You brings benefits to many interactions.</p>
<p>It can be used to diffuse tense situations, or to give recognition for a good job done.</p>
<p>Using Thank You correctly can soften criticisms and negative feedback.</p>
<p>For example: “Thank You for working so hard on this report, could we change a couple of items though?” or “Next time can we add this section?”</p>
<p>Saying Thank You to someone for a specific task or function can set a positive foundation for further communication, or future collaborations.</p>
<p>A Thank You can have positive effects on employees and clients.</p>
<p>Many companies have realised this and make a point of sending clients and workers ‘Thank You’ gifts to send a message of appreciation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeschicagocouncil/2019/09/09/the-importance-of-saying-thank-you-in-the-workplace/#45cf7a526a17" target="_blank">Forbes magazine</a>, companies that spend just 1% of their payroll budget on employee appreciation are “more likely to see better retention and financial outcomes.”</p>
<p>Happy and motivated employees lead to happy clients and that is good for business. </p>
<h2 id="thank-you-in-personal-relationships">Thank You in personal relationships</h2>
<p>How many times do you say ‘Thank You’ to your life partner or significant other?</p>
<p>Probably not as much as you should, and you should say it more. Much, much, more.</p>
<p>It took me a long time, and a lot of pain, to learn that lesson. But try it, I promise you will be pleasantly surprised by the results.</p>
<p>When partners believe they are valued it leads to better levels of commitment.</p>
<p>Showing appreciation influences how couples behave toward each other in a marriage.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that they can predict whether a relationship will endure purely based on the level of gratitude that partners display.</p>
<p>Studies show that even <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3283713/The-secret-happy-marriage-Saying-thank-Study-finds-gratitude-predict-couple-remains-together.html" target="_blank">failing marriages can be turned around</a> by simple, daily expressions of gratitude.</p>
<p>The more gratitude and appreciation expressed, the better chance the marriage has of thriving.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the recommended number of ‘Thank You’s’ is to say per day, but I am guessing the more the better 😁</p>
<p>Experience has shown me that increasing the amount and level of gratitude I express leads to more productivity, better relationships, and more pleasant interactions with people.</p>
<p>Even if they are absolute strangers.</p>
<p>So, get into the habit of saying ‘Thank You’ profusely. </p>
<p>Say it at work, to your spouse, to your colleagues, your relatives, your friends, even your kids. Trust me, your life will be better for it.</p>
