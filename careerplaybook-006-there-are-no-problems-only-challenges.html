<p>A simple word change leading to a mindset and perception shift.</p>
<p>You might have heard of the saying "There are no problems, only solutions".</p>
<p>When the solution is not obvious (yet) though, this can be a discouraging statement to hear.</p>
<p>The saying I have been using A LOT, and which changed my choice of words is "There are no problems, only challenges.".</p>
<p>I learned this a decade ago from one of my mentors and leader, Ben Sullivan.</p>
<p>Back then, I was using the word "problem" a lot in my interactions.</p>
<p>"We have a problem...."</p>
<p>"The problem is..."</p>
<p>Perhaps that was my French side üá´üá∑ü§îüòâ</p>
<p>In any case, while my mindset was to put the issues forward in a straightforward way, so as to be able to address them, using the word "problem" conveyed a sense of negativity.</p>
<p>This is particularly strong depending on the culture. Perhaps it was a French-American clash of cultures.</p>
<p>Using the word "challenge" instead of "problem" shifts the perception from a negative, to one that conveys the fact that it's just a hurdle, that needs to be overcome.</p>
<p>Personally, I love challenges - they are the ones who make you learn, grow and evolve, pushing you out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>When you lead a team, tackling a challenge together can be inspiring. Solving a problem is scarier.</p>
<p>In startups, especially in the early years, there are A LOT of challenges, on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So when there are no problems, only challenges, the road ahead is more exciting than depressing.</p>
<p>In my startups now, I even have a Slackbot in our Slack workspace to correct anyone using the word problem üòÅü§ì</p>
