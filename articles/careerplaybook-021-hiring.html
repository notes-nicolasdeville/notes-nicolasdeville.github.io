<p>When hiring an employee for a new position how do you assess their ability for the role?</p>
<p>Most people follow the usual process. Review their resume or CV, perform an interview with the candidate, and contact their references.</p>
<p>Once everything checks out and all the boxes are ticked, that is usually the point where you extend an offer of employment to the candidate.</p>
<p>But does this process guarantee that you are getting the <strong>best</strong> man or woman, for the job?</p>
<p>There are variable sand influences that cannot be predicted. </p>
<p>Like different employees or managers,  a different working environment, or a different company culture that may not gel with your candidate.</p>
<p>For these reasons, past success is definitely not a predictor of future success. Even if it is in the same role.</p>
<p>Successful recruiting can be elusive, there are times when you may feel you have the perfect fit for the position, and due to unpredictable factors it just doesn’t work out.</p>
<p>It is extremely frustrating when this happens, not to mention expensive. There is a <em>cost</em> associated with recruiting and unsuccessful hires can impact your bottom line.</p>
<p>To avoid this situation I have adopted a policy of hiring based on slightly different evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>While some base skills are always necessary, I make assessments based on other factors. </p>
<p>Suitability for the role is no longer based on previous work history and performance. </p>
<p>I take into account the candidates enthusiasm, attitude, communication style, attention to details, and their ability to learn.</p>
<p>This is based on the simple belief that skills can be taught; work ethic and attitude, cannot.</p>
<p>Some people have an inherent ability to turn their hand to any task and perform it well. They have a drive and a pride in their work that pushes them to function at a highly productive level.</p>
<p>While there may be a learning curve until this type of candidate gets fully acquainted with the business and tools, this is minimal compared to the benefits gained.</p>
<p>Once these people are fully up to speed, you can almost wind them up and watch them go!</p>
<p>These are the people that will take charge, or that you can hand off a task to with every certainty it will be done.  </p>
<p>These are the people that you come to depend on in your workforce. These are the people that will dedicate themselves to the cause and give you 120% effort.</p>
<p>Identifying them takes time, but for most managers and leaders, once they have experienced it, these traits become an instantly recognisable force in potential hires. </p>
<p>These are the A-gamers. The people that you wish that you could clone and create your entire workforce from. </p>
<p>Once you find them, you will find yourself looking for them in every new hire. And work history and references become secondary, if not completely irrelevant. </p>
<p>I recommend that the next time you hire, you challenge yourself to look beyond what’s on paper, or what past employers tell you, and look deeper to find these unique people. </p>
