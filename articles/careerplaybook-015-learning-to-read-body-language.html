<p>The other day, I was talking with someone, explaining an idea. She crossed her arms, and frowned. I interrupted myself mid-sentence and said..</p>
<p>"too complex?", with a smile.</p>
<p>"Yes" she said, smiling back, and uncrossing her arms.</p>
<p>And we brought back the discussion to a common level of understanding.</p>
<p>I was observing her body language and face expression while talking. And did not even wait for my sentence to end, to change gears accordingly.</p>
<p>I was very bad at that early in my career. Challenging for an introvert geek ü§ì</p>
<p>Then I read that nonverbal communication - how humans communicate beyond words, with body language and facial expressions - represents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication">two thirds of all communications</a>.</p>
<p>So if you are just listening to the words, you get only 1/3 of the message.</p>
<p>And the tip of the iceberg might conceal its real form beneath - meaning what people say sometimes does not reflect what they actually think. Shocking, I know! üòÅ</p>
<p>I discovered the book "What Every BODY is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People" by Joe Navarro &amp; Marvin Karlins in 2011 and plunged for a while into the science and tactics to improve oneself at "reading others".</p>
<p><a href="what-every-body-is-saying.html">"What Every BODY is Saying"</a></p>
<p>I learned to observe and read people's body language and face expressions, and adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>I'm not a natural at it, so I still need to learn and actively focus on it - perhaps that is why I feel strained when socialising for too long (and am not a big socialiser).</p>
<p>But I have been told that I can "read a room well".</p>
<p>My approach is to constantly observe the other - even while I talk - and bluntly make the observation about my perceived feeling of their mindset. The goal being to let the other reclaim the course of the discussion. I learned this is called "labeling" ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<p>"I can see I lost you" </p>
<p>is a phrase I use regularly, with a smile.</p>
<p>The answer can be "Yes, because..." or "No, no... but I was just thinking that....".</p>
<p>It is also obviously a critical skill in Sales, and to negotiate in general.</p>
<p>Someone's nonverbal cues when proposing a solution, presenting an idea or putting forward a price, will tell a lot and help make a better assessment. Which informs your decision for the next step.</p>
<p>That is why - for large deals - it has to be done in person where possible. Video-conference being the next best thing.</p>
<p>It is part of learning the art of negotiation:</p>
<p><a href="careerplaybook-012-learning-the-art-of-negotiation.html">#CareerPlaybook 012: Learning The Art of Negotiation is helpful for everyone</a></p>
<p>Are you a natural at reading others' body language, or did you learn? What resource has been the most useful to your learning?</p>
