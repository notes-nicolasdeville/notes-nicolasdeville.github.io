<p>There is increasing pressure, in the workplace and in daily life to be nothing short of perfect.</p>
<p>The truth is that as humans we are <em>far</em> from achieving a state of perfection.</p>
<p>We get things wrong, make mistakes, misunderstand, and misinterpret.</p>
<p>The tendency for some can be to bury their head in the sand, sweep away the error, and hope it remains undiscovered, or point the finger at someone else. </p>
<p>While this is used sometimes as a coping mechanism it actually serves no purpose, either to the person that made the mistake, or anyone else involved.</p>
<p>Owning up to our mistakes can have a <em>power</em> all of its own.</p>
<p>Owning up to mistakes can rectify the issue faster than it being hidden, and can create a team spirit, an ‘all hands on deck’ spirit to get the problem corrected as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Not to mention it can mitigate the array of related issues that may arise from not confessing in the first place.</p>
<p>In the workplace, it can inspire trust among employees and clients. </p>
<p>Seeing the leader or manager take full responsibility can inspire trust, foster an air of openness, and lead to more fulfilling collaborations.</p>
<p>In the words of Truman Capote - <strong>“Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.”</strong></p>
<p>Many great successes have arisen from absolute failures - </p>
<ul>
<li>Walt Disney was fired from the Kansas City Star because the editor felt he ‘lacked imagination and had no good ideas’</li>
<li>JK Rowling, the famous author of the Harry Potter series was a single mother living on welfare, rejected many times by publishers, before she hit the big time</li>
<li>Oprah Winfrey was raised in poverty and fired from her first TV job as she was deemed 'unfit for television'</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the achievements these 3 people have subsequently made, we can deduce that they must have been able to accept that they made mistakes early on.</p>
<p>Being willing to acknowledge mistakes and keep pushing forward is where the real strength lies.</p>
<p>The ability to admit to your mistakes reduces the embarrassment about making them in the first place, and people respect it.</p>
<p>Colleagues will trust you and look to you for guidance if they know you are willing to openly and honestly admit to your errors. </p>
<p>No-one likes a leader that blindly insists he or she is perfect, it is not <em>realistic</em>, nor does it inspire faith or confidence. </p>
<p>If you make a mistake take the following steps to put it right.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>*</em>*Raise your hand quickly, own up</strong>****</li>
<li><strong><em>*</em>*Admit to the mistake and identify it</strong>****</li>
<li><strong><em>*</em>*Do some damage assessment</strong>****</li>
<li><strong><em>*</em>*Take full responsibility</strong>****</li>
<li><strong><em>*</em>*Don’t try and apportion blame to others</strong>****</li>
<li><strong><em>*</em>*Make a strategic plan of action to correct the error</strong>****</li>
</ul>
<p>While this may not undo the damage it means that the problem can be addressed swiftly before causing a slew of related problem.</p>
<p>It gives you the opportunity to deflect and divert the issue before it gathers speed and becomes unstoppable.</p>
<p>Dealing with mistakes in this way will also give you the chance to assess and learn from the situation. </p>
<p>What went wrong? What could I have done better? What could I have done differently?</p>
<p>The next time you make a mistake, put up your hand without hesitation. </p>
<p>Trust me, there is more to be gained from it than lost.  </p>
