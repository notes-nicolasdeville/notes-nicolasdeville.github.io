<p>"What Every BODY is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People"<br>
by Joe Navarro &amp; Marvin Karlins.</p>
<p>I read a while ago, that nonverbal communication - how humans communicate beyond words, with body language and facial expressions - represents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication">two thirds of all communications</a>.<br>
So if you are just listening to the words, you get only 1/3 of the message.<br>
And the tip of the iceberg might conceal its real form beneath - meaning what people say sometimes does not reflect what they actually think. </p>
<p>Shocking, I know! üòÅ</p>
<p>I was not a natural at "reading people", but this book I read in 2011 got me on the journey of improving myself. I plunged for a while into the science and tactics to improve myself after reading it.</p>
<p>It remains the one resource I recommend to everyone though.</p>
<p>I learned to observe and read people's body language and face expressions, and adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>I'm still not a natural at it, so I still need to learn and actively focus on it - perhaps that is why I feel strained when socialising for too long.</p>
<p>But while in Sales, I have been told that I can "read a room well".</p>
<p>It has helped me a lot over the years.</p>
<p>Have you read another book on the topic that you recommend?</p>
