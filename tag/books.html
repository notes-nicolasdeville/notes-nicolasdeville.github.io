<h2>It's never too late</h2>
<p>While I'm tech-savvy, an overall geek, have tinkered with computers, and been working in Technology for the last 20 years, I never thought before a few years ago about learning to program, because it seemed "out of reach".</p>
<p>For some reason, I held to the perception that programming requires you to be good at advanced mathematics, and requires years of full-time practice ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<p>Aged 37 (it's never too late!) and triggered by a critical need, I came round to diving into it because I could not find a Tech co-founder for my 1st startup, and decided to do it myself. More here:</p>
<p><a href="/startupplaybook-01-how-to-bootstrap-a-tech-startup.md">How to bootstrap a Tech startup without a Tech cofounder</a></p>
<p>I wish someone had told me earlier that programming, and building tech solutions, is not that hard to learn, especially with tools available these days, and for the purpose of a MVP or early stage startup.</p>
<p>And realised I should have done that two decades ago! üôÑ</p>
<p>Truth is, programming is just another language. It's computer language.</p>
<p>And contrary to human languages, it's extremely logical (contrary to say, French grammar! üá´üá∑üòÖ).</p>
<p>All you need is good logic - better if innate, though learning to program will also help you think more logically and in a structured way - and perseverance.</p>
<p>I decided to learn <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
<p>It was described as an easy to learn language, extremely popular and gaining even more, and the primary language for all things AI and Machine Learning, which is a topic I'm passionate about.</p>
<p>In that journey of learning how to program - which has led me to build a startup heavily relying on automation, and my current startup, <a href="https://OfficeBots.io">OfficeBots.io</a>, focusing entirely on it - this one book has made all the difference for me.</p>
<h2>Perfect starting point for business people</h2>
<p>Most books and online courses about learning Python (or other programming languages) focus on the language itself, and in most cases will use the creation of a basic video game ü§ì to illustrate the learnings.</p>
<p>The 1st book I read about Python (for beginners) felt like I was reading chinese! Though I could read the words, so not quite that bad.. but I understood perhaps 10% of it üòÖ</p>
<p>The 2nd book was similar, though I understood a bit more.</p>
<p>With Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, everything clicked for me. üí°</p>
<p>Because the book is written with a background of automating things with commonly used office files - PDF, Excel, Word, etc..</p>
<p>The use cases made so much sense, and provided the context for me to relate the theory of the language, with its real-life applications.</p>
<p>It "blew my mind" as my mind started to race, thinking about all the potential applications.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>In my case, here are some applications I developed - with help from freelancers to troubleshoot, clean up my code (or redo it!):</p>
<h3>Automated invoice processing</h3>
<p>Supplier sends PDF invoice to dedicated email address. A bot written in Python, extracts the data, checks a couple things, flags to a human if needed, and provides the data in a format that can be ingested by our system, and that of our client (accounting system or CFRM).</p>
<h3>Price engine &amp; custom report generator.</h3>
<p>Fetches data from various sources (e.g. in-house CRM database, in-house flight records database) to generate custom internal or external reports in XLSX format.</p>
<h3>Data fetching</h3>
<p>Daily login to a portal, download of a CSV file and parsing data into our database.</p>
<h3>Hyper-personalised spam-safe emailing</h3>
<p>Send hyper-personalised emails at scale, sent directly from the actual local email client (no difference with a manually written and sent email, so no more risk to be caught in spam filters).</p>
<h3>Email finder</h3>
<p>Find email addresses at scale with just first name, last name and company website (from excel list).</p>
<h3>KPI Slackbot</h3>
<p>Slackbot publishing daily metrics, with data fetched across various systems (e.g. in-house CRM, Dropbox, etc..).</p>
<h3>Various scripts</h3>
<p>Along with a flurry of useful scripts for my day-to-day, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>splits PDFs with many pages into single page PDF files.</li>
<li>Custom URL shortener (Slackbot).</li>
<li>Formatting of Excel spreadsheets (so database exports look professional when sending to clients).</li>
<li>Happy password generator</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>I credit Automate the Boring Stuff with Python for being the seed that has helped me come up and build all of these.</p>
<p>And you can get help from freelancers, when you get stuck, or know what needs to be done, but lack the time to do it yourself. More here:</p>
<p><a href="careerplaybook-009-outsourcing-tasks/">#CareerPlaybook 009: Outsourcing Tasks</a></p>
<p>Ultimately, it is not about doing everything oneself. Low-value tasks should be delegated. Tasks for which your skills are not good enough, should be delegated.</p>
<h2>Chapters</h2>
<p>Here is an overview of its chapters, to give you a better sense of its content:</p>
<p>Chapter 0 ‚Äì Introduction</p>
<p>Chapter 1 ‚Äì Python Basics</p>
<p>Chapter 2 ‚Äì Flow Control</p>
<p>Chapter 3 ‚Äì Functions</p>
<p>Chapter 4 ‚Äì Lists</p>
<p>Chapter 5 ‚Äì Dictionaries and Structuring Data</p>
<p>Chapter 6 ‚Äì Manipulating Strings</p>
<p>Chapter 7 ‚Äì Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions</p>
<p>Chapter 8 ‚Äì Input Validation</p>
<p>Chapter 9 ‚Äì Reading and Writing Files</p>
<p>Chapter 10 ‚Äì Organising Files</p>
<p>Chapter 11 ‚Äì Debugging</p>
<p>Chapter 12 ‚Äì Web Scraping</p>
<p>Chapter 13 ‚Äì Working with Excel Spreadsheets</p>
<p>Chapter 14 ‚Äì Working with Google Spreadsheets</p>
<p>Chapter 15 ‚Äì Working with PDF and Word Documents</p>
<p>Chapter 16 ‚Äì Working with CSV Files and JSON Data</p>
<p>Chapter 17 ‚Äì Keeping Time, Scheduling Tasks, and Launching Programs</p>
<p>Chapter 18 ‚Äì Sending Email and Text Messages</p>
<p>Chapter 19 ‚Äì Manipulating Images</p>
<p>Chapter 20 ‚Äì Controlling the Keyboard and Mouse with GUI Automation</p>
<p>Appendix A ‚Äì Installing Third-Party Modules</p>
<p>Appendix B ‚Äì Running Programs</p>
<p>Appendix C ‚Äì Answers to the Practice Questions</p>
<p>As you can see, if you come at it from a business background, what you learn in chapters 1 to 11, will then completely make sense in chapters 12 to 20, as it puts the theory in the context of things you probably do on a daily basis.</p>
