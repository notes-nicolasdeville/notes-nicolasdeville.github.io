<h1 id="bant">BANT</h1>
<p>The OG. Too basic/inappropriate for most B2B sales these days though.   </p>
<p>It has been around for decades and its origins are unclear. It might have originated at IBM in the 1970s, or it might have been developed at Xerox in the 1980s.  </p>
<p>This methodology is used to qualify leads based on their budget, decision-making authority, specific needs, and timeline for making a purchase.  </p>
<p>BANT stands for:  </p>
<h2 id="budget">Budget</h2>
<p>The prospect's financial resources and whether they have the budget to purchase the product or service being offered.</p>
<h2 id="authority">Authority</h2>
<p>The decision-making power the prospect has within their organization, or whether they have the ability to influence the decision to purchase.</p>
<h2 id="need">Need</h2>
<p>The specific problem or pain point that the prospect is trying to solve with the product or service being offered.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>The prospect's timeframe for making a purchase or implementing a solution to their problem.</p>

<h1 id="meddic-aka-meddicc-or-meddpicc">MEDDIC (aka MEDDICC or MEDDPICC)</h1>
<p><span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/books/meddicc" target="_blank">MEDDICC, by Andy Whyte</a></span> </p>
<p>Developed in the 1990s by Jack Napoli, a Sales executive at PTC (software company).   </p>
<p>Big focus here is on having a champion within the organization who can help push the sale forward.  </p>
<p>It's a good framework, though I dislike its emphasis on disqualifying if no tested Champion. Real-world is less black &amp; white. One should do what it takes to get a champion, but deals have been won without one - especially in companies with a culture of keeping their cards closed to their chest (eg for compliance reasons).    </p>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>The specific goals or performance metrics that the prospect is trying to achieve or improve by purchasing the product or service being offered.</p>
<h2 id="economic-buyer">Economic Buyer</h2>
<p>The person or group within the prospect's organization who has the authority to approve the purchase and allocate the necessary budget.</p>
<h2 id="decision-criteria">Decision Criteria</h2>
<p>The specific factors or features that the prospect is looking for in a product or service, and the criteria they will use to evaluate potential solutions.</p>
<h2 id="decision-process">Decision Process</h2>
<p>The steps or stages that the prospect's organization goes through when making a purchasing decision, including who is involved and what criteria they use to evaluate potential solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't think a good Sales qualification methodology can miss that - except if forecasting is not a company priority (eg privately owned, with no external investors who expect results to be hit monthly/quarterly/annually).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/b2b-sales/decision-making" target="_blank">Understand and influence the decision-making process</a></span>   </p>
<h2 id="paper-process">Paper Process</h2>
<p>The specific requirements or steps that the prospect's organisation has in place for making a purchase, such as obtaining security, compliance, legal or procurement approval.</p>
<h2 id="identify-pain">Identify Pain</h2>
<p>The specific problem or pain point that the prospect is trying to solve with the product or service being offered.</p>
<p>Also important to IMPACT pain, ie ensure prospect <strong>feels</strong> the pain, and not just identify it.   </p>
<h2 id="champion">Champion</h2>
<p>A person within the prospect's organization who is an advocate for the product or service being offered and can help move the sale forward.</p>
<h2 id="competition">Competition</h2>
<p>The other products, services, or solutions that the prospect is considering or currently using, and how the product or service being offered compares to them.</p>

<h1 id="gpctbaci">GPCTBA/C&amp;I</h1>
<p>The GPCTBA/C&amp;I methodology was developed by HubSpot.   </p>
<p>This methodology adds an important, and overlooked aspect: the consequences and implications of not taking action (also called "Cost Of Inaction", which can be more powerful than the usual ROI <span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/b2b-sales/coi" target="_blank">Cost Of Inaction (COI)</a></span>).    </p>

<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>
<p>The specific strategies or initiatives the prospect has in place to achieve their goals and how the product or service being offered can fit into those plans.</p>
<h2 id="challenges_1">Challenges</h2>
<p>The obstacles or difficulties the prospect is facing that the product or service being offered can help address.</p>
<h2 id="timeline_1">Timeline</h2>
<p>The prospect's timeframe for making a purchase or implementing a solution to their problem.</p>
<h2 id="budget_1">Budget</h2>
<p>The prospect's financial resources and whether they have the budget to purchase the product or service being offered.</p>
<h2 id="authority_3">Authority</h2>
<p>The decision-making power the prospect has within their organization, or whether they have the ability to influence the decision to purchase.</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>The potential impact or consequences of not addressing the prospect's challenges and how the product or service being offered can help mitigate those consequences.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>The broader implications of the prospect's challenges on their business or industry and how the product or service being offered can help address those implications.</p>

<h1 id="which-one-is-the-best">Which one is the best?</h1>
<p>First: any is better than none.   </p>
<p>Second: it depends on your product, your market, and your sales process.  </p>
<p>My personal view: they all bring something to the table, and the best is a custom one. </p>
<p>✅ I personally like:  </p>
<ul>
<li>the COI (Cost Of Inaction) <span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/b2b-sales/coi" target="_blank">Cost Of Inaction (COI)</a></span> angle in the GPCTBA/C&amp;I methodology.  </li>
<li>the Paper Process in the MEDDPIC methodology (especially for forecasting accuracy purposes, ie not if but when a deal will close).  </li>
</ul>
<p>❌ I personally dislike: </p>
<ul>
<li>methodologies relying on "is budget available" as a qualifier. I have won many deals where the budget was not available from the get go. A good Sale of a good solution will make budget available.       </li>
<li>hard disqualifiers based on "great to have but can be done without" (eg a tested Champion in MEDDICC or exisiting need in BANT)*.  </li>
<li>"urgency" criteria, limiting to short-term sales &amp; forecasting. I worked on long sales cycle deals, sometimes closing the largest deals in the company's history. Those take time, especially when you're creating the need. Assessing timeline yes, disqualifying based on lack of current urgency, no.</li>
</ul>
<p>* I'm a fierce disqualifier, but not for those reasons.  </p>
