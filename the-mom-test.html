<p>"The Mom Test", by Rob Fitzpatrick</p>
<p>Its full and clearer title is “The Mom Test: How to talk to customers &amp; learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you”.</p>
<p>If you are a founder working through Customer Discovery, or even a Product Manager, I highly recommend “The Mom Test” by Rob Fitzpatrick which I just read.</p>
<p>Helped me identify some mistakes I am making, and gave me quite a few good actionable insights and questions to use.</p>
<p>It came out in 2013. Wish I had found it earlier!</p>
