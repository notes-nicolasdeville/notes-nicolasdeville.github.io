<p>"A picture is worth a thousand words" - this applies especially when communicating online (using email, Slack, or any other solution).</p>
<p>In lots of cases, what you need to write to your recipient consists in depicting (representing in words) what you see on your own computer screen.</p>
<p>Rather than writing words (even if it's less than a thousand), sending a screenshot - perhaps enhanced with annotations - is often the best way, and helps alleviate misunderstandings. This is especially the case when the communication language is not the native language of the people involved in the exchange.</p>
<p>Showing, not telling.</p>
<p>For a long time, I simply used the computer's built-in screenshot feature.</p>
<p>For the last 3 years, I have been using a tool called <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/">CloudApp</a> - and it is now a must-have in my work toolkit, that I used daily.</p>

<p>First, here is a quick demo:</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Whenever you need to show something to someone, or when showing something saves you from typing a lot of text, CloudApp steps in. So the usages are quite broad.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>interacting day-to-day with team and colleagues</li>
<li>onboarding new employees or freelancers</li>
<li>supporting customers</li>
<li>putting task briefs together</li>
</ul>
<p>and the list goes on</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>It's as simple as it gets.</p>
<p>Once installed, a simple keyboard shortcut will get you ready for action and you can then just paste the link (<code>Cmd + V</code>) in your email or messaging app.</p>
<p>Cloudapp runs in the background, and takes care of everything. It uploads your content to their cloud (by default at least) and makes it available for sharing.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a screenshot</li>
<li>record a 1mn GIF</li>
<li>record a video (your screen and/or you)</li>
<li>and even upload an existing image or video for sharing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_menu.gif">and just share a link to it.</p>
<h3>Capture</h3>
<p>On Mac (PC is probably similar):</p>
<p><code>Cmd + Shift + 5</code> to take a screenshot</p>
<p><code>Cmd + Shift + A</code> to take a screenshot you want to annotate</p>
<p><code>Cmd + Shift + 6</code> to record a GIF or video</p>
<p>You can select the area you want to capture, or a specific window.</p>
<p>When you use the GIF/Video option, you have a few settings available before starting to record:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_video.png">### Annotate</p>
<p>Here is how you can annotate quickly something:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_annotate.gif">Quite a few tools and customisations are available:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_annotations.png">### Share</p>
<p>Once you have taken your screenshot or video (or clicked "Copy Link" if you needed to annotate), just paste the link (<code>Cmd + V</code>) anywhere you like - email, Slack message - as CloudApp copies the link automatically in your clipboard.</p>
<p>If you need the actual image, rather than a link to it, just drag and drop:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_inserting.gif">#### Links unfurl in selected apps</p>
<p>By that I mean when pasting a CloudApp link, some apps will automatically display its content, rather than require the user to click on the link to see it.</p>
<p>Example in Slack:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_unfurl.gif">#### Trackable links</p>
<p>CloudApp will tell you when a link (image or video) has been viewed.</p>
<p>By email if you wish:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_viewed.png">Or simply in the interface:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_views.png">#### Share with custom links</p>
<p>On a paid plan, instead of links looking like that:</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/p/5d121341-62a1-46de-8394-9b8440fbc984/share.getcloudapp.com">https://share.getcloudapp.com/lluygo1J</a></p>
<p>you can use your own domain to customise them, like that:</p>
<p><a href="https://share.officebots.io/lluygo1J">https://share.officebots.io/lluygo1J</a></p>
<h2>Your visual memory</h2>
<p>As the name says.. it's a cloud app.</p>
<p>This means you can access your "visual snippets" anywhere:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_webapp.png">You can also search them (made easier if your name your files), categorise them and more.</p>
<h2>Call To Action buttons</h2>
<p>A newly released feature, that I have not yet used myself, is the ability to use a CTA button, on the page where your content is seen by the user.</p>
<h2><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_cta.png">Settings</h2>
<p>I always like to dig into the Preferences of any app I use, so if you are the same, here they are:</p>
<h3>Your online account settings</h3>
<p>Here are the settings available in your online account:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_settings.png">### Your local app settings</p>
<p>Once you install the app, here is what you can set:</p>
<h2><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_preferences01.png"><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_preferences02.png"><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_preferences03.png"><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_preferences04.png"><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_preferences05.png">Privacy &amp; Security</h2>
<p>CloudApp is hosted on AWS in the US - so only downside of the standard service is that your data (images and videos) is hosted outside of EU.</p>
<p>If you wish to host the files on in your own AWS S3 bucket ("S3 buckets" is the name for Amazon's web hosting service), you can:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_settings_storage.png">Though the company states that you remain owner of your data, and their business model does not have any advertising side to it (ie no incentive to sell data).</p>
<p>More about their security: <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/security">https://www.getcloudapp.com/security</a></p>
<h2>Pricing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create and Share Video, Gifs and Screenshots</li>
<li>5 Min Video Recording Limit</li>

<p>Here are all the details:</p>

<h2>ROI</h2>
<p>CloudApp helps you estimate your Return On Investment, by sharing your stats with you:</p>
<p>Not quite sure how they calculate time saving estimations - and it's probably inflated - but it does look impressive:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/cloudapp_stats.png">Beyond the estimated 100 hours I saved since starting using CloudApp, it has massively simplified my online communications and collaborations.</p>
<p>This being critical when working remotely, CloudApp is a no-brainer for everyone collaborating online a lot.</p>
