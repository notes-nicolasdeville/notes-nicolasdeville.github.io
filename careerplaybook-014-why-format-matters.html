<p>I learned in school to first write the content, then to format it.</p>
<p>Never liked that.</p>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the formatting (design) is the first thing that the recipient will perceive, and it will influence her/his assessment of the work.</p>
<p>Starting with the design helps put the context in which the content will be consumed.</p>
<p>Always delivering professional looking documents will ensure it sets the reader in a positive mindset to assess the content.</p>
<p>Formatting is a reflection of you as a professional - obviously hand in hand with the content itself.</p>
<p>You would not show up to a meeting in scrubby clothes, unwashed, just coming out of bed.</p>
<p>The same applies, in my views, to any document or communication your are sharing - internally or externally.</p>
<p>They represent you. They convey an image of you.</p>
<p>Good formatting inspires trust.</p>
<p>Great formatting can make a lasting impression.</p>
<p>In startups especially, competing against large companies with more resources, it's important to</p>
<p>a) look bigger than you are</p>
<p>b) make an impression</p>
<h2>How I focus on format first</h2>
<p>As I was building my last startup, I learned about graphic design - and with a mixture of knowing enough about the tools (see below) and working with (low-cost) freelancers, we created documents that made an impact.</p>
<p>We were working in Business Aviation (the niche industry around private jets) and a prospect told me "We usually see that level of professionalism only in commercial aviation" (which was meant as a compliment).</p>
<p>So be it with emails or formal documents - proposals, presentations, agreements, reports - be it internally or externally, I usually think first about the format.</p>
<p>I visualise in my head what it should look like, what it should convey, even before recipients start reading its content.</p>
<p>As I compose documents, I think about ways to make the content more visual - enrich with graphics for example, or multimedia if web-based.</p>
<h2>Leverage tools</h2>
<p>If you struggle with creating good formatting yourself, there are plenty of tools out there to help you with templates.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Office suite has templates that can be used for free. Already providing a more professional looking design than just bare bones formatting of a blank sheet.</p>
<p>Software solutions (SaaS, ie "in browser") have democratised access to powerful tools and empowered the "citizen formatter".</p>

<p>If you like to learn and create your own formatting, I highly recommend learning to use the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> apps</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html">Adobe Creative CloudEnjoy the entire collection of our creative desktop and mobile tools, like Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Adobe Premiere Pro, and more with Adobe Creative Cloud.<img alt="" src="https://www.adobe.com/favicon.ico">ADOBE CREATIVE CLOUD<img alt="" src="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/icons/creativecloud.svg"></a> from <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/indesign.html">InDesign</a> (layout) to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a> (graphics) and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a> (picture editing), all are very powerful tools, working nicely together, that put you fully in control.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/design/graphic-design/">Udemy</a> has plenty of good courses on Graphic Design:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/design/graphic-design/">Graphic Design Online Courses - Create and Edit Digital ArtMaster all aspects of graphic design by enrolling in courses that will train you in typography, drawing, photo editing, logo creation, and more.<img alt="" src="https://www.udemy.com/staticx/udemy/images/v6/favicon-196x196.png">Udemy<img alt="" src="https://www.udemy.com/staticx/udemy/images/v6/default-meta-image.png"></a>Learning at least the basics, will help you understand more of what is possible, and communicate with designers in a better way.</p>
<p><em>Note: you don't need to be an artist or designer to benefit from learning the basics - trust me, that is what held me back a long time from learning to use these powerful tools.</em></p>
<h2>Outsource</h2>
<p>If you don't want the hassle of learning a new tool, you can always rely on the army of designer freelancers available.</p>
<p>Here is a detailed blog post about how to outsource tasks:</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/careerplaybook-009-outsourcing-tasks/">#CareerPlaybook 009: Outsourcing Tasks (are you still doing everything yourself?)Ultimately, it is not about doing everything oneself. Low-value tasks should be delegated. Tasks for which your skills are not good enough, should be delegated.<img alt="" src="__GHOST_URL__/favicon.png">Nicolas DevilleNicolas Deville<img alt="" src="images/2020/02/CP009_blog.65b7d5f4176b4140abc7eb8be5f59042.svg"></a>The designer I used at my 1st startup - who did a lot of designs I could not do as well, or simply where I lacked the time - was based in the Philippines and charging $25/hour, to give you an indication.</p>
<p>It is particularly useful, when designing templates, that you will be reusing again and again.</p>
<h2>Format matters</h2>
<p>Whatever approach and tool you use, just ensure what you provide your prospects, clients, boss, colleagues or suppliers reflects the image of yourself and your company you want to project.</p>
