<p>The other day, I was explaining something to a woman.</p>
<p>She interrupted me (in a nice way though), saying ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to mansplain to me‚Äù.</p>
<p>It took me aback ü§î. I was shocked üò±. Embarrassed üò≥. I lost my words. And spent a few days reflecting on her comment.</p>
<p>What I was explaining to her, I would have explained the same way to a man.</p>
<p>Long before the #MeToo movement, I have been a proponent and active contributor to diversity and gender equality in the workplace.</p>
<p>The teams I have built had a good gender balance.</p>
<p>I work very well with women (even co-founded a startup where we decided my wife would be the CEO), and women work well with me, at least based on the feedback I got over the years.</p>
<p>My conclusion is:</p>
<p>the challenge with ‚Äú-isms‚Äù (sexism, racism, ageism) is that if one suffers the consequences from it regularly, s/he will default to seeing it as the reason behind.</p>
<p>I do communicate a lot ‚Äì because I think both high-level and low-level, and like to share and provide more context, to help people understand better.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not a communication style that works with everyone.</p>
<p>But mansplaining for me is explaining something:</p>
<ul>
<li>the woman should know better than a man</li>
<li>to the woman in a group of men</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you are a woman, please do not assume that I‚Äôm mainsplaining things ‚Äì just that I overcommunicate! üòá</p>
<p>Has anyone had a similar experience?</p>
