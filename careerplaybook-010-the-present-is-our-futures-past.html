<h2>What will your future self think of the present you?</h2>
<p>For a lot of business or personal decisions, I project myself in the future, looking at the present as being my past.</p>
<p>And I ask myself:</p>
<p>"What will I want my past to be?"</p>
<p>"How will I feel about my present self?"</p>
<p>" Will I regret this decision?"</p>
<p>This is what drove me to</p>
<ul>
<li>quit a successful job in Paris and move to London with just a backpack</li>
<li>quit a well-paid job to start my own startup (ultimately sold successfully)</li>
<li>leave London and move to the German countryside</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time pushing me outside my comfort zone, but thinking that my future self would have regretted my present self not giving it a shot.</p>
<p>I find it a great way to think about things, and it helps make small or big decisions - both professional and family-related.</p>
<p>It's similar to how Jeff Bezos Â describes his "Regret Minimisation Framework", though it sounds more scientific... and has not worked for me as well so far! :)</p>
<h2>Life as a book</h2>
<p>Another way to think about it - and at the risk of losing you - let me get cheesy for a second: your life is a book that you are writing one sentence at a time. One page at a time. One chapter at a time.</p>
<p>So the question I'm asking myself is: when I read the book of my life, at the end of it, what will I want to read?</p>
<p>And then making decisions based on what my future self will want to read.</p>
<h2>Dealing with tough times</h2>
<p>Furthermore, that outlook helps a lot getting through tough times - which happen a lot in life in general, and especially in #startups.</p>
<p>Whatever challenge or difficult time I'm going through, ultimately it will only be a page out of many in the book of my life (take that as an allegory - I am not planning to write an autobiography!).</p>
<p>Perhaps even just a paragraph, or a sentence.</p>
<p>A very small moment in time.</p>
<p>From which I will be able to learn something, even if it is not clear yet what. I'll have to write and read those learnings later.</p>
<p>It helps to see things in the bigger picture.</p>
<h2>Working in Technology</h2>
<p>When you love Technology, and work in it, it is also a very helpful mindset.</p>
<p>Technology grows fast. So when seeing a technology solution today, it is essential to see it as a the past of what the future could bring.</p>
<p>Especially when building it and selling it (so you can paint a vision of how it will evolve and change things), investing in it, or simply theorising and discussing about it.</p>
<p>Do you think about things that way too?</p>
