<h3 id="value-stream-management-vsm">Value Stream Management (VSM)</h3>
<p>is a business and software development methodology and practice that aims to optimize the flow of value through an organization's processes, particularly in the context of software development and delivery. It is often associated with Agile and DevOps practices and is used to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization's value delivery processes.</p>
<h3 id="portfolio-management">Portfolio Management</h3>
<p>strategic planning and oversight of a collection of projects, initiatives, or products within an organization. <br>
It involves making decisions about which projects or products to invest in, how to prioritize them, and how to allocate resources to maximize the overall value delivered to the organization and its customers. Portfolio Management is closely related to VSM because it helps ensure that an organization's investment in various value streams aligns with its strategic goals and objectives.</p>
<h3 id="agile-planning-and-delivery">Agile Planning and Delivery</h3>
<p>refers to the set of practices, processes, and methodologies used in Agile software development and project management to plan, prioritize, and deliver work in an iterative and flexible manner. It is a critical component of Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), which emphasize adaptability, collaboration, and customer-centricity.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>It was really good to meet you yesterday - I like your style &amp; you got me excited about Planview and the opportunity.</p>
<p>After sleeping over it, I confirm my eagerness to move forward.</p>
<p>At market level - the accelerated rate of innovation (especially AI) means a solution like Planview can become a question of survival for large organisations, considering the risk of being disrupted by smaller, more innovative &amp; agile competitors. <br>
Downstream, it is enabling constant alignment of work - projects, initiatives, products - with the (evolving) strategy of the company.<br>
Upstream, it ensures a better "finger on the pulse of the organisation", with real-time visibility of progress &amp; risks, to enable timely course correction, better desicion making and informing future strategy. <br>
Both are critical for them to stay competitive &amp; survive the fast-changing world ahead.</p>
<p>At personal level - leading &amp; driving a team, selling to large enterprises is what I'm the best at. Combined with it being a high-ticket strategic solution, applicable to most businesses, makes it a very attractive opportunity for me.</p>
<p>I have many questions - and will ensure to provide more colour around how I hire &amp; onboard, along with how I manage my team &amp; business.</p>
<p>I realise though that initial alignment with &amp; enthusiasm about meeting you might be somewhat limited in its value to me, as you'll only be my n+2.<br>
As you can understand, my direct line of report is critical for my decision, so it will be good to meet with Alex, early in the process, to validate our alignment.</p>
<p>Can you confirm that the empty seat &amp; 2 potential rotations in the team are based in Germany?<br>
Historically, my network has been one of my primary source for candidates, though I have not worked Germany in a while, so I need to think about it, considering urgency here.</p>
<p>I'll await Kerry's outreach to schedule the next call(s), if your night led to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the day today with your son - though it may be tinged with mixed emotions? (I'm still a few years away from that milestone to experience that myself).</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Nic</p>

- will need to keep 2 opps running in the background. One for Dryfta (with Intel) and the other for Hubilo (with Lexmark). Each could represent the largest deal in their respective companies, and is the result of hard work I'd like to see through, both <br>
This would just be typical deal closing activities, without any travel, so very time limited. </p>

<p>Uncapped commission?   </p>
<p>Can I contact the guy I'm replacing? Understood he might not want to talk but would like to get his take.   </p>
<p>Hiring <br>
Usually with a mixture of recruiters and network. More weight towards recruiters to start with and over time more via network. <br>
Getting the team excited helps by tapping into the reps' own network which creates leverage the day will do the selling, so candidates come in as hot referrals - easier sell.   </p>
<p>If appropriate, I bake in a role play step as 2nd call with a candidate. Goal is to assess several things, but not specifically product understanding as primary criteria. <br>
Research, clarity of thought and communication, mindset and coachability are the most important traits I assess with this exercise.   </p>
<p>Pro club. Explain? <br>
Weekly one to one more sacred. <br>
Time to realign and coach. <br>
Work in meetings when possible - better to get out of the box answers and going deeper.   </p>
<p>Set a clear vision, long term, to help motivate on bigger goal than just the immediate task at hand, which can be frustrating or painful. <br>
Define clear goals and metrics, with the underlying logic for setting these. Using buy in on how full slash why helps with commitment and motivation. <br>
Begin hiring, understanding the person's long term goal and dreams is important. Helps align motivations, and incentives to get the best out of the person.   </p>
<p>Interview step with someone at same level, ideally future collaborator. <br>
Helps getting a different point of view on the person " from the floor ". <br>
Again if collaborator is sold and will talk positively about the company and me as a leader, it helps sell the position, so bilateral benefits.   </p>
<p>Sharing role play I like to provide as much constructive criticism as I can. Helps assess coachability and feedback loop acceptance.   </p>
<p>More iq than eq. <br>
I love to solve business problems, either internally or for the client. This is what makes me good for slash I'm appreciated by every sales for slash leadership in every company I have been at, as well as why I have closed the largest deals at every company. <br>
I do not do well bonding at the personal level, with my team. But I focus instead on ensuring I get to know them professionally and help them improve on that front, keeping their long term ambitions in mind. This creates a bond which is reflected in the recommendations you can see on my profile.   </p>
<p>Depending on the tool tools ask the new hire during onboarding to spend time digesting meetings and slack channels ask them to rephrase in their words the opportunity and what they would have done better.</p>
<p>Tactical but i care a lot about can i use my own mac computer?</p>
<p>Hiring-recruiters. i have a few close relations, for example with bms as i have worked with dan for a dozen years a dozen years. but i also have my own database with thousands of recruiters. i can run a emailing campaign sharing precise profile.</p>
<p>For account based focus and abm, kpi is number of people talked to within the account. for sales not marketing.</p>
<p>Research competitive landscape. <br>
R check all reviews.  </p>
<p>Focus on german automotive?</p>
<p>Current achievement over quota of the team and forecast for slash projection for year end. Uncapped commission? <br>
Commission structure?  </p>
