<h3 id="value-stream-management-vsm">Value Stream Management (VSM)</h3>
<p>is a business and software development methodology and practice that aims to optimize the flow of value through an organization's processes, particularly in the context of software development and delivery.

<h3 id="portfolio-management">Portfolio Management</h3>
<p>strategic planning and oversight of a collection of projects, initiatives, or products within an organization. <br>
It involves making decisions about which projects or products to invest in, how to prioritize them, and how to allocate resources to maximize the overall value delivered to the organization and its customers.

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>It was really good to meet you yesterday - I like your style &amp; you got me excited about Planview and the opportunity.</p>
<p>After sleeping over it, I confirm my eagerness to move forward.</p>
<p>At market level - the accelerated rate of innovation (especially AI) means a solution like Planview can become a question of survival for large organisations, considering the risk of being disrupted by smaller, more innovative &amp; agile competitors. <br>
Downstream, it is enabling constant alignment of work - projects, initiatives, products - with the (evolving) strategy of the company.<br>
Upstream, it ensures a better "finger on the pulse of the organisation", with real-time visibility of progress &amp; risks, to enable timely course correction, better desicion making and informing future strategy. <br>
Both are critical for them to stay competitive &amp; survive the fast-changing world ahead.</p>
<p>At personal level - leading &amp; driving a team, selling to large enterprises is what I'm the best at. Combined with it being a high-ticket strategic solution, applicable to most businesses, makes it a very attractive opportunity for me.</p>
<p>I have many questions - and will ensure to provide more colour around how I hire &amp; onboard, along with how I manage my team &amp; business.</p>
<p>I realise though that initial alignment with &amp; enthusiasm about meeting you might be somewhat limited in its value to me, as you'll only be my n+2.<br>
As you can understand, my direct line of report is critical for my decision, so it will be good to meet with Alex, early in the process, to validate our alignment.</p>
<p>Can you confirm that the empty seat &amp; 2 potential rotations in the team are based in Germany?<br>
Historically, my network has been one of my primary source for candidates, though I have not worked Germany in a while, so I need to think about it, considering urgency here.</p>
<p>I'll await Kerry's outreach to schedule the next call(s), if your night led to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the day today with your son - though it may be tinged with mixed emotions? (I'm still a few years away from that milestone to experience that myself).</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Nic</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>It was good to talk to you again yesterday &amp; learning more about Planview and your Modus Operandi - though I felt I didn't shine.</p>
<p>Interviews can be tricky!</p>
<p>Ultimately my startup experience &amp; mindset mean I'm adaptable &amp; used to experimenting, learning from it and iterating.</p>
<p>I'm a fast learner and avid reader, with a curious mind &amp; bias for action.</p>
<p>Some of the frameworks I use will need to be adapted to Planview's context, but I'm confident I can do that quickly.</p>
<p>Separately, while it's fairly random, I share (some of) my notebook online - nothing polished, just notes.<br>
Browsing it could give you a deeper sense of who I am &amp; how I do things, eg.:</p>
<p>https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/b2b-sales/</p>
<p>If you want to proceed to next steps, I'm looking forward to speaking with Alex.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Nic</p>
<p>REMOVE: <br>
And while the average ACV at Planview is higher than my past experiences, my ability to close the largest deals at every company show an alignment with complex dealmaking &amp; ability to create the need at C-level.</p>
<h1 id="learnings">Learnings</h1>
<ul>
<li>be more decisive &amp; to the point (it's an interview, not a discussion)</li>
<li>put my network forward (eg. for hiring)</li>
<li>be more structured in my answers (use STAR - Situation/Task/Action/Result)</li>
<li>focus on earlier stage companies (more building &amp; figuring out, less applying existing playbook)</li>
<li>fake it til you make it</li>
</ul>
<p>Good at:<br>
- Navigate an enterprise to map stakeholders, build champions, generate buy-in and close deals with C-Level decision makers</p>
