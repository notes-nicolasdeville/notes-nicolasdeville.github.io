<h1 id="review">Review</h1>
<p>I read MEDDICC late in the game (ie 20 years into my Sales career), as part of a sales engagement in 2021 where we implemented this framework internally.   </p>
<p>MEDDICC is a <strong>Qualification Methodology</strong> covering:    </p>
<p>M = Metrics   <br>
E = Economic Buyer    <br>
D = Decision Criteria<br>
D = Decision Process  <br>
I = Impact Pain <br>
C = Champion <br>
C = Competitors    </p>
<p>also known as MEDDPICC where:   </p>
<p>P = Paper Process   </p>
<p>I don't agree with some aspects - eg disqualify when no Champion - but it is a robuts qualification framework overall.   </p>
<p>Every book/framework has benefits &amp; downsides anyway - and the ultimate framework is a custom one (ie tailored to the specifics of your business).    </p>
<p>If you don't have a methodology in place for Sales qualification at the moment, it's a good choice to implement this one.  </p>
<p>Though as always devil is in the implementation 😄    </p>
<p>A good complementary read for (VP) Sales people to cover the entire Sales process (and not just the Qualification aspect):   </p>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">It helps Sellers qualify if they should be in a deal at the start, but it also allows Sellers to continuously qualify, not just whether they should be in the deal but whether they are on top or behind.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 36</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">“The art of persuasion is a paradox. The more we attempt to persuade people, the more they tend to resist us. But the more we attempt to understand and create value for them, the more they tend to persuade themselves.”</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">When you combine all of the resources you have at your disposal, it is almost like you have a franchise within the organization you work for, only you didn't have to buy it, and they pay you a salary. If you take this franchise mindset into qualification, you'll quickly realize that the only resource you truly have is time.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 39</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">No Pain/Willingness to Change If you haven't been able to uncover enough pain or a willingness to change the pain you have discovered, then this is a pretty strong signal that you should qualify out.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 41</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">An exception may be where you feel these circumstances may be limited to the person or department you are talking to, and via working with other stakeholders, you may find more pain/willingness to change.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 41</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Your Solution Doesn't Fit A common qualification error is when Sellers identify that their solution doesn't fit the solution's requirements or may solve some elements of the requirement. Still, it isn't a good fit, and yet they persevere with the opportunity trying to make their square peg solution fit through the customer's round hole problem. Usually, this is because the Seller can't stand to lose,</div>

<div class="book_quote_location">page 42</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">If the Customer Refuses to Allow You to do Discovery Much rarer is the inexperienced buyer who refuses the Seller the opportunity to do any kind of discovery. Their favorite phrase is, "We are not here to tell you about us, we are here for you to tell us about your solution." Of course, Sellers should politely push back and try to persevere with discovery, but if the customer remains uncooperative, you should qualify out of the opportunity. I have never met a customer who does this and has enough seniority to get a deal done, and I doubt you will either. Regardless, without being able to do discovery, you are selling blind and most likely wasting your time.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 42</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">If You are in Doubt, Qualify Out It is my firm belief that if you have any concerns about the qualification of your deal after applying MEDDICC to it, you should qualify out. Qualifying out because of doubt will commonly have one of two effects: Your customer will accept your position and rationale for not pursuing the opportunity with them further. Your customer will disagree with your position and try to convince you why you should pursue the opportunity with them.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">By causing the customer to consider this negative scenario, we were forcing them to feel Implicated by the pain, which is the final step of the Three I's transition: Identify pain> Indicate pain> Implicate pain.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Discovery is the most critical part of any enterprise sale. No other element will have such a significant impact on the success of your deal.</div>

<div class="book_quote">

When we listen with curiosity, we don’t listen with the intent to reply. We listen for what’s behind the words.”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 64</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">To actively listen in your discovery process, you need to: Truly listen to what your customer is saying. Don’t just be looking for angles to sell against. Play back what you have heard. Whether you paraphrase or use your own words depends on your style and the situation.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 64</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">When the customer feels that you care and value their thoughts, they are more likely to elaborate upon them, thus opening the conversation to more in-depth discovery.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 65</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">There are seven types of big questions that are super starting points for uncovering valuable information early in your deal cycle. They can come in many forms, but they generally sound like: What is working? What is not working? When it works, what good things happen? When it does not work, what bad things happen? Whom does that affect? How much does that cost? Why haven’t you tried to solve it yet?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 65</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">These Sellers approach their customers with a bank of questions intended to uncover pains that they can then sell against. This experience is awful for the customer; they sit there while the Seller bluntly digs for pain that they know will be used against them to try and make them buy the Seller’s solution.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Salespeople often raise the concern that if they don't start selling soon enough, the opportunity may not progress. My response to this is straightforward—don't engage in opportunities where you feel as though you are walking a tight rope of engagement from the customer. It is always hard for salespeople to qualify out, especially when they think they have genuine value to offer. Still, if you are being forced to sell before uncovering real pains, goals, or challenges, then you are wasting your time. The only way to solve this situation is to find Pain, and if you aren't being given a chance to do that, go and work with a customer who deserves your expertise.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">ECONOMIC BUYER The Economic Buyer is the person with the overall authority in the buying decision. An Economic Buyer is usually one person within an organization who is the overall authority in which the budget for your project rolls up to, however, occasionally, the Economic Buyer can consist of more than one person and, in some instances, is a committee of people.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 123</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">A fear Sellers often have if they have been blocked by their Champion from engaging with the Economic Buyer is that the Champion will be upset if they engage directly. John Kaplan at Force Management has an ace way of circumnavigating this issue and that is to write what he calls ‘The Champion Letter’. This is a letter written to the Economic Buyer that introduces yourself and your solution whilst, at the same time, praising your Champion for what an outstanding job they are doing on the project. You can even call out all of the value they have helped you to uncover.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Using a Senior Executive to Engage Aligning your senior executive team with their peers within the customer’s organization is good practice.

<div class="book_quote_location">page 128</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">For example, imagine you have just landed a meeting with your number one prospective customer within your territory. You are excited and begin planning for the first meeting. In your research, you uncover an article written by their Chief Digital Officer talking about an initiative that your solution will support. You ask one of your senior execs to reach out to the CDO and mention that she has heard that her team is meeting with the CDO’s team. She also references the article and how she feels your solution can provide value to help her with her initiative. The message doesn’t contain any ask, it simply just introduces your senior exec and positions her executive support on the project. It is often good to close with a promise to update the CDO following the meeting on how you heard it went, which leaves the door open for a follow-up.</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Elite Sellers know that keeping the Economic Buyer informed on the progress of the implementation of the solution will reap rewards later on for the Seller, when they want to re-engage in a renewal or upsell conversation.

No matter how you obtain the Decision Process, whether it is clearly articulated to you via a formal document or you have it from a thorough discovery process, it is likely that more parts will be added to it that you are yet to uncover or that don’t exist yet. For this reason, you need to stay in discovery mode to hunt down any changes as well as seek confirmation of the process and where you stand against it at every opportunity.</div>

Either dollars missed out on being earned or less profitable dollars being earned. Efficiency Pain: This relates to a Pain that is occurring because something prohibits the organization from being efficient or effective. The quantification of Efficiency Pain is usually time: the time it takes or the number of resources required for a process to occur. People Pain: This relates to pain that impacts the People in the organization either by productivity, morale, skill, or ability.

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">At a high level, you should be looking to uncover the following information within the early stages: Metrics - Your Champion should help you confirm the Metrics you have identified are applicable. Economic Buyer - Your Champion should help you identify who the Economic Buyer is, and you should discuss an introduction. Decision Criteria - Your Champion should be able to explain the Decision Criteria to you if they have one, or work closely with you to define one if they don’t. Decision Process - Your Champion should take you through the Decision Process if they have one or help you understand how the Decision Process flows. Implicate Pain - Your Champion should be open to you, discovering where their pain is and helping you quantify it. Competition - Your Champion should be able to give you some information about who your competition is</div>
