<p>Most of it is obvious, but nonetheless a good framework for when starting in a new role.    </p>
<h1 id="my-highlights">My highlights</h1>
<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Engaging in the wrong type of learning. You spend too much time focused on learning about the technical part of the business and not enough about the cultural and political dimensions of your new role. You don’t build the cultural insight, relationships, and information conduits you need if you’re to understand what is really going on.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 15</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Neglecting horizontal relationships. You spend too much time focused on vertical relationships—up to the boss and down to direct reports—and not enough on peers and other stakeholders. You don’t fully understand what it will take to succeed, and you miss early opportunities to build supportive alliances.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 15</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Sticking with what you know.</div>

<div class="book_quote_location">page 14</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Leadership ultimately is about influence and leverage. You are, after all, only one person. To be successful, you need to mobilize the energy of many others in your organization.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 17</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Transition failures happen because new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or lack the skill and flexibility to adapt to them.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 18</div></div>

<div class="book_quote_location">page 18</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results that will help you get to the break-even point more rapidly.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 18</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Negotiate success.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 19</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Achieve alignment.</div>

<div class="book_quote">

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Keep your balance.</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Accelerate everyone.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 19</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Begin by thinking about your first day in the new job. What do you want to do by the end of that day? Then move to the first week. Then focus on the end of the first month, the second month, and finally the three-month mark. These plans will be sketchy, but the simple act of beginning to plan will help clear your head.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 21</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">No matter where you land, the keys to effective delegation remain much the same: you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 26</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">When you get promoted, however, what you delegate usually needs to change. If you’re leading an organization of five people, it may make sense to delegate specific tasks such as drafting a piece of marketing material or selling to a particular customer. In an organization of fifty people, your focus may shift from tasks to projects and processes. At five hundred people, you often need to delegate responsibility for specific products or platforms. And at five thousand people, your direct reports may be responsible for entire businesses.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 26</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Decision making becomes more political—less about authority, and more about influence. That isn’t good or bad; it’s simply inevitable.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 26</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the decision-making game becomes much more bruising and politically charged the higher up you go. It’s critical, then, for you to become more effective at building and sustaining alliances.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 26</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Leaders joining new companies often are making lateral moves: they’ve been hired to do things that they’ve been successful doing elsewhere. Their difficulties lie in adjusting to new organizational contexts that have different political structures and cultures.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 28</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">To overcome these barriers and succeed in joining a new company, you should focus on four pillars of effective onboarding: business orientation, stakeholder connection, alignment of expectations, and cultural adaptation.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 30</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Stakeholder Connection</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 31</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">don’t want to be meeting your neighbors for the first time in the middle of the night when your house is burning down.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 31</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Expectations Alignment No matter how well you think you understand what you’re expected to do, be sure to check and recheck expectations once you formally join your new organization.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 31</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">recruiting is like romance, and employment is like marriage.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Cultural Adaptation</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 32</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">In doing this, it helps to think of yourself as an anthropologist sent to study a newly discovered civilization.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 32</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">What is culture? It’s a set of consistent patterns people follow for communicating, thinking, and acting, all grounded in their shared assumptions and values.</div>

<div class="book_quote_location">page 34</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Meetings. Are meetings filled with dialogue on hard issues, or are they simply forums for publicly ratifying agreements that have been reached in private?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 34</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Execution. When it comes time to get things done, which matters more—a deep understanding of processes or knowing the right people?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 34</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Conflict. Can people talk openly about difficult issues without fear of retribution?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 34</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Recognition. Does the company promote stars, rewarding those who visibly and vocally drive business initiatives? Or does it encourage team players, rewarding those who lead authoritatively but quietly and collaboratively?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 34</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Ends versus means. Are there any restrictions on how you achieve results? Does the organization have a well-defined, well-communicated set of values that is reinforced through positive and negative incentives?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 34</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Onboarding checklists Business orientation checklist As early as possible, get access to publicly available information about financials, products, strategy, and brands. Identify additional sources of information, such as websites and analyst reports. If appropriate for your level, ask the business to assemble a briefing book. If possible, schedule familiarization tours of key facilities before the formal start date. Stakeholder connection checklist Ask your boss to identify and introduce you to the key people you should connect with early on. If possible, meet with some stakeholders before the formal start. Take control of your calendar, and schedule early meetings with key stakeholders. Be careful to focus on lateral relationships (peers, others) and not only vertical ones (boss, direct reports). Expectations alignment checklist Understand and engage in business planning and performance management. No matter how well you think you understand what you need to do, schedule a conversation with your boss about expectations in your first week. Have explicit conversations about working styles with bosses and direct reports as early as possible. Cultural adaptation checklist During recruiting, ask questions about the organization’s culture. Schedule conversations with your new boss and HR to discuss work culture, and check back with them regularly. Identify people inside the organization who could serve as culture interpreters. After thirty days, conduct an informal 360-degree check-in with your boss and peers to gauge how adaptation is proceeding.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 35</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">You can do a lot to compensate for your vulnerabilities. Three basic tools are self-discipline, team building, and advice and counsel.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 39</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">If you have been hired from the outside, ask for help in identifying and connecting with key stakeholders or finding a cultural interpreter. These people often are natural historians who can give you insight into how the organization has evolved and changed.</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">A baseline question you always should ask is, “How did we get to this point?”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 45</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Effective leaders strike the right balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting).</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 45</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 45</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Leaders who are onboarding into new organizations must therefore focus on learning and adapting to the new culture. Otherwise they risk suffering the organizational equivalent of organ rejection syndrome (with the new leaders being the organs). They do things that trigger the organization’s immune system and find themselves under attack as a foreign body.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 45</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">How should you compile your early list of guiding questions? Start by generating questions about the past, the present, and the future (see boxes, “Questions About the Past,” “Questions About the Present,” and “Questions About the Future”).</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 47</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">One approach is to keep to the same script in all your meetings. You might start with brief opening remarks about yourself and your approach, followed by questions about the other person (background, family, and interests) and then a standard set of questions about the business.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 53</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Ask them essentially the same five questions: What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face in the near future)? Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges? What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth? What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities? If you were me, what would you focus attention on?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 53</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Once you have distilled these early discussions into a set of observations, questions, and insights, convene your direct reports as a group, feed them back your impressions and questions, and invite discussion. You will learn about both substance and team dynamics and will simultaneously demonstrate how quickly you have begun to identify key issues.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 54</div></div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">If you’re meeting with salespeople, for example, consider asking, What do our customers want that they’re getting from our competitors and not getting from us?</div>

Seek resources that both support your boss’s agenda and advance your own. Look for ways to help peers advance their agendas in return for help with yours. Link resources to results. Highlight the performance benefits that will result if more resources are dedicated to your unit.

Does this person exercise good judgment, especially under pressure or when faced with making sacrifices for the greater good? Energy. Does this team member bring the right kind of energy to the job, or is she burned out or disengaged? Focus. Is this person capable of setting priorities and sticking to them, or prone to riding off in all directions? Relationships. Does this individual get along with others on the team and support collective decision making, or is he difficult to work with? Trust.

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Prepare for each meeting. Review available personnel history, performance data, and other appraisals. Familiarize yourself with each person’s technical or professional skills so that you can assess how he functions on the team. Create an interview template.

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Keep in place. The person is performing well in her current job. Keep and develop. The individual needs development, and you have the time and energy to do it. Move to another position. The person is a strong performer but is not in a position that makes the most of his skills or personal qualities. Replace (low priority). The person should be replaced, but the situation is not urgent. Replace (high priority). The person should be replaced as soon as possible. Observe for a while. This person is still a question mark, and you need to learn more before you can make a definitive judgment about them.</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">An inspiring vision has the following attributes: It taps into sources of inspiration. It is built on a foundation of intrinsic motivators, such as teamwork and contribution to society. One orthopedic medical device company, for example, had “Restoring the joy of motion” as its vision statement, accompanied by stories about injured athletes being able to compete again, and grandparents being able to hold their grandkids. It makes people part of “the story.” The best statements of vision connect people to a larger narrative that provides meaning—for example, a quest to recapture the organization’s past glories. It contains evocative language. The vision must describe in graphic terms what the organization will achieve and how people will feel to have achieved it. Launching twelve rockets in ten years is a goal; putting a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the decade, as President John F. Kennedy put it, is a vision.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">True adversaries will oppose you no matter what you do. They may believe you’re wrong in your assessments of the situation. Or they may have other reasons for resistance to your agenda: Comfort with the status quo. They resist changes that might undermine their positions or alter established relationships. Fear of looking incompetent. They fear seeming or feeling incompetent if they have trouble adapting to the changes you’re proposing and perform inadequately afterward. Threats to core values.

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Consultation promotes buy-in, and good consultation means engaging in active listening. You pose questions and encourage people to voice their real concerns, and then you summarize and feed back what you’ve heard. This approach signals that you’re paying attention and taking the conversation seriously. The power of active listening as a persuasive technique is vastly underrated. It can not only promote acceptance of difficult decisions but also channel people’s thinking and frame choices. Because the questions leaders ask and the ways they summarize responses have a powerful effect on people’s perceptions, active listening and framing are a potent persuasive technique.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Choice-shaping is about influencing how people perceive their alternatives. Think hard about how to make it hard to say no. Sometimes choices are best posed broadly, at other times more narrowly.

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Social influence is the impact of the opinions of others and the rules of the societies in which they live. The knowledge that a highly respected person already supports an initiative alters others’ assessments of its attractiveness.

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Incrementalism refers to the notion that people can move in desired directions step-by-step when they wouldn’t go in a single leap.

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Action-forcing events get people to stop deferring decisions, delaying, and avoiding commitment of scarce resources. When your success requires the coordinated action of many people, delay by a single individual can have a cascade effect, giving others an excuse not to proceed. You must therefore eliminate inaction as an option. You do this by setting up action-forcing events—events that induce people to make commitments or take actions. Meetings, review sessions, teleconferences, and deadlines can all help create and sustain momentum: regular meetings to review progress, and tough questioning of those who fail to reach agreed-to goals, increase the psychological pressure to follow through.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">All these syndromes can contribute to dangerous levels of stress. Not all stress is bad. In fact, there is a well-documented relationship between stress and performance known as the Yerkes-Dodson curve, illustrated in figure 9-1.2 Whether stress is self-generated or externally imposed, you need some stress (often in the form of positive incentives or consequences from inaction) to be productive.
