<div class="book_quote_highlight">“Jim,” I said, “tell the group what the hockey saying, ‘skate to the open ice’ means.” “It means skating with the puck to the part of the ice where there is open space and time. Then, as you skate, constantly sensing when you’re running out of time and space and passing the puck to your teammate,” Jim explained. “Same analogy applies when we are talking with customers. Take the time and space they give you to get as much information as possible but be acutely aware of when to pass information to them about the impact your product can have on their business or customer success stories.”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 99</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">For example, reps need to know base knowledge items below, without thinking: The customer persona The customers use case The persona job measures Typical pains in the use case Open-ended discovery questions Their unique product differentiators How their product differentiators solve pain Typical quantifiable value of their solution Customer success stories with before and after scenarios</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 99</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Being immersed in the conversation is a constant loop of four core actions: 1. Questioning: Asking the open-ended questions 2. Listening: Listening to understand 3. Confirming: Verifying your complete understanding 4. Feeling: Sensing the customers response</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 100</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The rep should share the confirming email with you and calendar the customer meeting for the next stage to indicate completion of Discovery.”</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Activity without a deep analysis of results, without ever understanding the cause of the reps’ selling problems, is meaningless.</div>

<div class="book_quote_location">page 109</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Because the rep is solely focused on whiz-bang product features instead of business issues, they never gain access to people high in the account, who are oriented toward operating the business.</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Anyone with experience knows, “you get relegated to whom you sound like”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 110</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">‘Let me give you an analogy. Most internal and external people think I’m a firefighter. But I’m actually a forest ranger. I overlook millions and millions of acres of land. My job is to think of the long-term safety of our people, our intellectual property, and potential threats that could affect the entire land mass. That means I can’t put out all the fires. Some fires will burn. Let them burn. I have to focus on preventing and extinguishing the largest fires that threaten our company.’ “Then he looked straight at me and said, ‘Shannon, every company has fires, most of which they can live with. If you want to sell high in an organization, get above the noise.’” Her voice quieted slightly here. “That’s a saying I won’t forget. ‘Above the noise.’”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 114</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">“From now on, I want you to stop saying POC and start saying POV, Proof of Value. Proof of Concept is pointless. Your product works. You’re not trying to prove the concept of your technology functioning. What is important is that you can prove that your product capabilities deliver business value to the customer for their specific use case.”</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">three major parts to the journey: Scoping: A method to understand and quantify their business pain and outline a potential POV. (The method will decide if there is alignment between product capabilities and pain, between seller capabilities and customer value.) A Go/No-Go Meeting: A meeting with the Economic Buyer to confirm whether or not the pain is a priority to solve The POV: An outline of the POV criteria, incorporating the required product capabilities and timeframe for a POV The Scoping journey will generate three documents for review: A Cost Justification with as-is and to-be metrics A POV Plan that directly correlates to the POV criteria and preliminary cost justification A Preliminary Pricing Proposal which is a price quote based upon the preliminary cost justification</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 118</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">“No wonder I can’t find Champions,” Kathleen muttered. “I never understand the business implications of not solving the pain. What potential Champion would care if we don’t seem to be offering the solution they need? It’s why we wind up with low-level coaches.”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 119</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">shared the entire process on the board: Create a list of unique and defensible product differentiators. Target pain points that the differentiators solve. Map pain points to specific use cases. Quantify the business benefits of solving pains in each use case. List the negative consequences of customers not solving the pain. Discover companies/industries which have those specific uses cases. List the specific personas that own those use cases. Prioritize companies and industries based on highest customer value.</div>

<div class="book_quote_location">page 131</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">“Let’s wrap up Scoping by adding to this.” Found business pain creates opportunity. Quantified business pain drives higher price points. Implicated business pain drives urgency. Business pain and urgency finds business Champions. Business champions get you to the Economic Buyer. The Economic Buyer has access to major funds. You sell big deals based on value.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Question to Ask the Economic Buyer Where in your priority list does this particular problem rank? What specific business measure does this issue most effect? When would you prefer to solve this issue? Would you be willing to allocate budget for $Y? E.g., If we could prove during the Validation Event that we could save your company $X for an investment of $Y, would you allocate $Y budget? Besides yourself, is there anyone else required to approve a purchase of this size? If we are successful in the POV, what would be the remaining steps in your decision process?</div>

You and I have never done this before.” At first, I stared at him, startled into silence. But then I thought about the genuineness of his answer in admitting that he didn’t know. “Figure it out,” he said. “Make the best decision you can with the information you have. And use your gut. Your best instincts. If it turns out you made the wrong decision, change it quickly. Don’t get married to your decisions. Don’t tie your ego to your decisions.”</div>
