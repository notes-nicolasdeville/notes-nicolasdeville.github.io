<h1 id="review">Review</h1>
<p>TL;DR:<br>
One of the best, if not the best VP Sales playbook.<br>
Essential read for anyone in Sales - VP Sales &amp; CROs obviously, but also reps &amp; founders/CEOs.   </p>
<hr>
<p>I recently finished reading what I believe is one of the best sales books for B2B enterprise sales. It is a first-person account of a consulting engagement with a software company in need of improving their sales team, led by a 5x CRO named John McMahon, who worked at well-known software companies.  </p>
<p>The book is written in a clever and engaging format, avoiding the common pitfall of sales books that provide generic advice that lacks context or applicability. As a reader, you follow the journey of the consulting engagement as if you were a fly on the wall, gaining insight into John's approach and techniques.   </p>
<p>This book is a must-read for anyone in an active role in enterprise B2B sales, including VPs of Sales looking to improve or revisit the foundations of their knowledge, sales contributors at any level, sales trainers wanting to understand what best-in-class looks like, and CEOs of enterprise solutions. It covers all the basics of sales, supported by concrete examples and real-life interactions between the sales trainer and the sales trainees.   </p>
<p>I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to improve their enterprise B2B sales or Sales leadership skills.  </p>
<p>It is both easy to read and informative, covering the foundations of a Sales process, and Sales leadership.   </p>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">I wrote a simple logic chain on the whiteboard:</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight"><br></div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- Find pain</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">- Champions get you to the Economic Buyer</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">“Jim,” I said, “tell the group what the hockey saying, ‘skate to the open ice’ means.”</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">“It means skating with the puck to the part of the ice where there is open space and time. Then, as you skate, constantly sensing when you’re running out of time and space and passing the puck to your teammate,” Jim explained. “Same analogy applies when we are talking with customers. Take the time and space they give you to get as much information as possible but be acutely aware of when to pass information to them about the impact your product can have on their business or customer success stories.”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 99</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">For example, reps need to know base knowledge items below, without thinking:</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight"><br></div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- The customer persona</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- The customers use case</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- The persona job measures</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- Typical pains in the use case</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- Open-ended discovery questions</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- Their unique product differentiators</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- How their product differentiators solve pain</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- Typical quantifiable value of their solution</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">- Customer success stories with before and after scenarios</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 99</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Being immersed in the conversation is a constant loop of four core actions:</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight"><br></div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">1. Questioning: Asking the open-ended questions</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">2. Listening: Listening to understand</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">3. Confirming: Verifying your complete understanding</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">4. Feeling: Sensing the customers response</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 100</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The rep should share the confirming email with you and calendar the customer meeting for the next stage to indicate completion of Discovery.”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 102</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Activity without a deep analysis of results, without ever understanding the cause of the reps’ selling problems, is meaningless.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 107</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Customers buy the benefit they get from your product, not the product itself.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 109</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Because the rep is solely focused on whiz-bang product features instead of business issues, they never gain access to people high in the account, who are oriented toward operating the business.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">“From now on, I want you to stop saying POC and start saying POV, Proof of Value.</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Proof of Concept is pointless. Your product works. You’re not trying to prove the concept of your technology functioning. What is important is that you can prove that your product capabilities deliver business value to the customer for their specific use case.”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 117</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">three major parts to the journey:</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight"></div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Scoping: A method to understand and quantify their business pain and outline a potential POV. (The method will decide if there is alignment between product capabilities and pain, between seller capabilities and customer value.)</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight"></div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">A Go/No-Go Meeting: A meeting with the Economic Buyer to confirm whether or not the pain is a priority to solve</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight"></div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The POV: An outline of the POV criteria, incorporating the required product capabilities and timeframe for a POV</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The Scoping journey will generate three documents for review: A Cost Justification with as-is and to-be metrics </div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">A POV Plan that directly correlates to the POV criteria and preliminary cost justification</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">A Preliminary Pricing Proposal which is a price quote based upon the preliminary cost justification</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 118</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">“No wonder I can’t find Champions,” Kathleen muttered. “I never understand the business implications of not solving the pain. What potential Champion would care if we don’t seem to be offering the solution they need? It’s why we wind up with low-level coaches.”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 119</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">shared the entire process on the board:</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight"><br></div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Create a list of unique and defensible product differentiators.</div>
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Target pain points that the differentiators solve.</div>
