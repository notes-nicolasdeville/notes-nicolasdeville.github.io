<div class="book_quote_highlight">Every category here is the price of doing business—table stakes. If you don’t have the essential stack nailed, you are underinvesting in your team and already being lapped by competitors. Ensure you’re buying all of these. Pricey?

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Move beyond the simple binary emails and calls you make to connect with a prospect after adding them on LinkedIn. The future is multi-threaded, omni-channel opportunities created based on key pieces of data served up to a rep, or given to a rep by the lower-level prospects, data that are then disseminated to higher-level executives in prospect accounts in such a way that they influence a buying motion that is more meaningful. You take away some of the manual nature of their jobs, then SDRs can live a life of creating relationships at scale, backed by extreme air cover from increasingly capable revenue operations and enablement functions who are using technology to its maximum potential and training reps to do the same.18</div>

They are thinking, “What do you want and why should I care?” They also want you to “be brief and be gone.” Anything too long is just ignored. Be easy to do business with by having a clear call to action that is simple.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Another approach is to consider the person you are trying to establish your credibility with and provide them with an example of how you helped a similar persona, rather than focusing entirely on the industry they are in. Some prospects could care less about how you solved a pain for another company in their industry. If they’re a VP of Sales, they probably care just as much about how you helped another VP of Sales with a specific pain they may also be facing. Even if it’s in a completely different industry, that pain and social proof will resonate far better than relying on logos. This is especially true for companies that are targeting SMB-Mid Market companies. If you’re using a client like Adobe for your social proof to a company with fifty employees, it’s not going to be compelling. In fact, it may do the opposite. Since you may not have social proof for a company similar to them that’s recognizable, focusing on the pains of the persona you are reaching out to and drawing social proof from a similar persona can be extremely productive.7</div>

According to Mark: “We’re running SDR Outbound via SalesLoft using email, call, LinkedIn plus Video. We add to this retargeting (across LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram) while contacts are in cadence. It’s exciting to see the combo of outbound and inbound ads in the same workflow! We’re leveraging ActiveCampaign in Salesforce with smart rules that automatically trigger paid media campaigns when someone moves into cadence inside SalesLoft. They see the ad and automatically get moved into the SalesLoft cadence. It’s mind-blowing.”17</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">LinkedIn engaged in a watershed legal case against hiQ who (along with thousands of others) were machine reading public-facing data. LinkedIn believed that scraping violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a 1986 law that makes computer hacking a crime. After LinkedIn issued a cease-and-desist order, hiQ sued, asking courts to rule that its activities did not, in fact, violate the CFAA or constitute hacking. The result? David defeated Goliath; hiQ won the initial case in late 2017 with US District Judge Edward M. Chen in San Francisco granting a preliminary injunction giving hiQ access to LinkedIn. In his twenty-five-page opinion, Judge Chen said that the 1986 CFAA was not intended to outlaw the collection of online public information.</div>

We’ve taken that philosophy and morphed it into a whole social signals modus operandi. If someone comments on a status update and they are relevant, call and sequence them. If someone views your profile, send a sequence to them. If you notice someone commenting passionately, even on any random thread, use that as a signal to initiate outreach to them around that topic.

<div class="book_quote_highlight">The best sale you can ever make stems from a warm referral. You are five times more likely to open an opportunity referred to you by a trusted common relationship. This is because referrals start a new relationship with a degree of trust. Referrals also shorten sales cycles, improve win rates, reduce the presence of competition, and are the lowest-cost source of new leads. We simply need to ask the right way and at the right time. Anytime a client expresses happiness with our level of service or satisfaction with our product or solution, it is an opportunity to ask for a referral.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 128</div></div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">When seeking a referral, simply use phrases like these: Thanks for saying that! Who else do you think we could help? Thanks for the feedback! Who else struggles now with what we’ve solved together? Thanks! Who else should I be talking to in the organization?</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Again, here is our greatest tactical secret for referrals . . . prove you were referred. Screenshot the message inside LinkedIn and send it inline in the email. “Lucy said we should talk.” Insert the screenshot that proves it. Even in social, capture an image and show you were referred by sending the screenshot inside LinkedIn. In emails, forward the referral thread to the target.

<div class="book_quote_highlight">The acquisition of Slack by Salesforce in December 2020 was a genius move for more than the obvious reasons. Private B2B Slack channels are beginning to vet the buyer and seller in pay to play environments where CXOs join to learn about trends and insights. Vendors pay but can’t sell; they must instead share use cases. This model has legs where LinkedIn has become too noisy. Some now describe LinkedIn as the narcissistic echo chamber of annoying sellers, and the depreciation of LinkedIn Groups has already caused an exodus into private Slack Groups. The future of B2B is paid micro communities within platforms such as Slack, Patreon, or Discord where membership criteria controls the quality of the vendors placed in front of the CXO.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">Many SDRs and companies get lost in the trap of focusing on only decisionmakers when the reality of the consensus sale means that anywhere from five to ten or more are realistic targets to start conversations with. Having the ability to go up and down a given department to start conversations is one of the best ways to adhere to an ideal customer profile. It also gives you the opportunity to leverage referrals and responses moving through that org chart in order to triangulate your value proposition for the most relevant audience.

<div class="book_quote_highlight">“Coming inbound should be a simple and pleasant process for your leads. Consider setting up your inbound machine to book meetings directly with SDRs. Rather than having the lead fill out a form and wait for a response, direct them to a calendar after they fill out the form so they can book a meeting immediately after. Now, the SDR doesn’t have to worry about the lead slipping through the cracks or doing unnecessary back-and-forths, and instead has a time on their calendar to speak with the prospect, qualify them, and book a follow-up call right then and there with the appropriate AE if they think it’s worth moving forward.”</div>

The fundamental problem with a template that everyone uses is . . . everyone uses it and it becomes ineffective. Yes, you can still close big deals if you follow the tenets of anchoring high at the C-level and then push for meetings at the next top layer. If you get delegated down, report back to the senior person you started with. Multi-threading to all stakeholders who form consensus for change is essential, but we must avoid being blocked by a mid-level “seymour syndrome” operative who loves to comparatively analyze all the vendors but has no decisionmaking power.

From calendaring, to list building, to pre-call research, there’s almost nothing tedious you are doing now that you can’t farm out easily. Even if your boss won’t pay for it, put your hand in your own pocket! Start behaving like you are running a territory franchise and think like a businessperson rather than a salaried rep. This approach gives you real competitive advantage and pays for itself in additional commissions . . . or in just keeping your job. If you wake up in the morning with a hundred, or even a thousand, perfect contacts and your competitor takes days or weeks to send a sequence with a 30 percent bounce rate, you have a time edge and penetration advantage . . . game over, you win.</div>

In general, neighborhooding and setting meetings with like-minded people attending events is a good strategy. Throwing events while at conferences is also very powerful.
