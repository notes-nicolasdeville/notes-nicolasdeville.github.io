<p><span class="datestamp">29 Oct 2022</span> late notes:   </p>
<p>As I dive into AI, with a Sales lens, I'm reminded of this book from last year: Tech-Powered Sales - Achieve Superhuman Sales Skills. <br>
It's the new "Hacking Sales". If you are in B2B Sales, at any level, it's a must-read to:
- understand what best-in-class looks like when leveraging today's SalesTech stack
- envision what Sales could (will) look like as Technology continues to progress
- just plainly stay relevant in the future, as a Sales contributor or Sales leader  </p>
<p>Honestly, the book could be half as long, edited better and/or dive more into "how to" (though I understand the authors want to sell their services and keep some of the magic for themselves :) ).
It's also missing on the Sales workflow automation front.</p>
<p>BUT it does articulate 2 critical points that everyone in Sales should know and understand:
- the importance of TQ (Technology Quotient) in addition to IQ &amp; EQ (good news for those who score lower on one of those two, like me!)
- the current benchmark (and what the future benchmark is most likely to be) of high-performing Sales teams when leveraging Technology at its best.</p>
<p>There is A LOT of name-dropping of tools, just like "Hacking Sales" in its time, so it also helps making sense of the SalesTech jungle and get you going in the right direction.    </p>

Even if it’s in a completely different industry, that pain and social proof will resonate far better than relying on logos. This is especially true for companies that are targeting SMB-Mid Market companies. If you’re using a client like Adobe for your social proof to a company with fifty employees, it’s not going to be compelling. In fact, it may do the opposite. Since you may not have social proof for a company similar to them that’s recognizable, focusing on the pains of the persona you are reaching out to and drawing social proof from a similar persona can be extremely productive.7</div>

David defeated Goliath; hiQ won the initial case in late 2017 with US District Judge Edward M. Chen in San Francisco granting a preliminary injunction giving hiQ access to LinkedIn.

Now, the SDR doesn’t have to worry about the lead slipping through the cracks or doing unnecessary back-and-forths, and instead has a time on their calendar to speak with the prospect, qualify them, and book a follow-up call right then and there with the appropriate AE if they think it’s worth moving forward.”</div>
