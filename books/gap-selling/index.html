<h1 id="review">Review</h1>
<p>Probably the #1 book I'd recommend Sales reps in my team to read.   </p>
<p>It's an easy read, more informal than most, yet clear on what selling means and how to do it.  </p>
<p>Combined with a book like "The Qualified Sales Leader" <span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/books/the-qualified-sales-leader" target="_blank">The Qualified Sales Leader, by John McMahon</a></span> or a Sales qualification book (like MEDDIC <span class="nic_link"><a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com/books/meddicc" target="_blank">MEDDICC, by Andy Whyte</a></span>) it covers most of what one needs to know about Sales execution.   </p>
<h1 id="my-highlights">My Highlights</h1>
<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">It’s Not That You Can’t Sell—It’s That You Can’t Diagnose</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 14</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Your product doesn’t drive the sale. The problem does, and if you can’t diagnose the problem, no sales skill or any other sales training is going to help you.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 14</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">That’s why you get no answer to 99% of your cold emails. They don’t highlight a problem that resonates with the buyer.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 14</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">You get beat up on price because solving the problem isn’t worth what you’re asking.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 14</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Being a great salesperson means being able to diagnose the customer’s problem and understanding the impact the problem is having on their business.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 14</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">See, at the heart of every sale, there’s a gap. It’s a gap between what buyers have now and what they believe they want in the future, between who they are now and who they want to be tomorrow, or even where they are now and where they want to go. This gap represents the value of the sale to the buyer and the salesperson. Without it, there is no sale.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 16</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Every selling challenge we salespeople face can be traced to the gap; every solution stems from identifying it, properly assessing its value, and selling to it (which, as you’ll see, is totally different from selling a product or service).</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 17</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">You’re not losing deals today because you don’t work hard, or don’t care, or you’re dumb. No, you’re losing deals because you don’t know what you don’t know. You don’t understand the rules of the selling game.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 18</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">You’re sitting at your desk going through your pipeline, rubbing your temple. Damn, your head hurts! Just as you’re thinking about running to the convenience store to buy some ibuprofen, a wildly energetic, friendly guy wearing a red plaid shirt magically shows up at your office door. It’s me, Keenan. Hey, whassup! I hold out a small black box. Lying there on the black felt is a small, FDA-approved white pill guaranteed to make your headache disappear in one dose. How much would you pay for my pill? Fifty cents? $1.50? $5.00? How about a million dollars? Would you pay that? You roll your eyes. A million dollars to make a headache go away? Yeah, whatever. Then I start asking you questions: Does this headache come on frequently? Does it affect your vision? How’s your balance? Do your limbs ever feel weak? Have you felt nauseated recently? Have you ever experienced numbness or spasms in your face? Your answer is yes. To all of it. An immediate visit to your doctor, who orders an MRI scan, confirms the worst: You have a brain tumor. Does a million bucks still sound like too much for my pill? Yeah, I didn’t think so.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 19</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">No problem, no sale In every sale there’s a gap All sales are about change Customers don’t like change Sales are emotional Customers do like change when they feel it’s worth the cost Asking “Why?” gets customers to “Yes” Sales happen when the future state is a better state No one gives a shit about you</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 19</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Truth # 1: No Problem, No Sale</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 20</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">This frustration with the problem acts as the catalyst for change.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 20</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">It’s this lack of connection to the problem that undermines the ability of the salesperson to effectively sell and ultimately close the deal.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 20</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Understanding the problem is so critical because with the problem comes the impact of the problem and the impact defines the size and scope of the problem.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 20</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Problems get you to the impact and the impact is where urgency, value, and need live and where the sale takes root.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 20</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Truth # 2: In Every Sale, There’s a Gap</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 20</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Every sales transaction is about identifying a gap—the distance between where customers are now (their current state) and where they want to be (their future state).</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 20</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Frequently, however, the gap only appears small, and a little digging around reveals an impending sinkhole. Sometimes the gap appears bigger than it really is. Sometimes, it doesn’t seem like there’s a gap at all. But you can’t know for sure what’s real unless you look closely.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 20</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The worst thing in the world you can do at the beginning of a sale is to take your buyer’s word for granted or sell to a need.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 20</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Sure, they think they know what their problem is, but what if they’re wrong?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 21</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Never sell to need. If you only solve the problem your buyer thinks they have instead of the one they really have, you haven’t helped them at all. You’re like a doctor treating the symptoms instead of the disease.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 21</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">You’re like a doctor who has completely missed the fact that there is a disease!</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 21</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Gap selling is a process of tactfully challenging buyers’ assumptions, exposing (and sometimes confirming) the true size of their problem, then correctly assessing the impact it will have on their lives. The more impact, the larger the gap. And the larger the gap, the more valuable the solution, i.e., your product or service.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 22</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Answer this: Why do customers buy?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 22</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">In other words, they feel a need to change.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 23</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Truth #4: Customers Don’t Like Change (Even When They Say They Do)</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 23</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">humans suffer from longevity bias, the phenomenon in which we ascribe more positive feelings toward things that have been around for a while than toward things that are new.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 24</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">even when people say they want change, deep down they often fear it.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 24</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Truth #5: Sales are Emotional</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 24</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Every sale is about change. Change is emotional. Therefore, every sale is emotional. And emotions are complicated. That, in a nutshell, explains why selling is so hard and why so many people are bad at it.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 24</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">there are ten threats that cause people to resist change.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 25</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">1. Loss of control</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 25</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">2. Excess uncertainty</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 25</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">3. Surprises</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 26</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">4. Too much change at once</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 26</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">5. Loss of face</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 26</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">6. Insecurity</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 26</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">7. Extra work</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">8. The ripple effect</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">9. Past resentments</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 27</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">10. Real danger</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 27</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">It’s incredibly difficult to get people to change their opinions through sheer reasoning.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 27</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Truth #6: Customers Do Like Change When they Feel It’s Worth the Cost</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 27</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Closing a sale is about helping customers feel safe enough to lay their defenses down and share their problems, then getting them to a point where they feel secure and confident enough to admit they’re ready for change—either to something better, or to get away from something painful.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 28</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Truth #7: Asking “Why” Gets Customers to “Yes”</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 29</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Every time you ask “Why?” you chip away at the surface layers of your customer’s psyche to get to their intrinsic motivations, the whole reason why they ever gave you a chance to talk to them in the first place.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 29</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Knowing your customer’s intrinsic motivation allows you to solve for the problems your customers didn’t know they had.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 29</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">You will have to learn to dig deep and not give up your line of questioning until you thoroughly understand the driving force behind your customer’s motivation to change</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 29</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The only thing that inches you toward a sale is proving that you understand your customers’ problems and the impact of those problems, that you know why they’re struggling, that you understand why they’re not happy with their current state, that you hold the key to moving them to the future state they desire, and that the change they are facing will be worth the money and effort it takes to get there.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 30</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Truth #8: Sales Happen When the Future State is a Better State</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 30</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">You can’t sell a future state (where your customer wants to be) unless you have a firm grasp on your customer’s current state (where your customer is now).</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Guiding your customers to take note of the impact that various problems are having on their business isn’t just another fact-finding expedition—it’s going to force them to recognize the level of urgency with which they need to treat these problems.</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The thing is, most salespeople focus on solving the technical problems when it’s the business problems that create a customer’s unique buying motivations and lead to the biggest gaps.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 68</div></div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">The business problem is what is going to drive the sale, so you need to understand it and how it uniquely presents itself within your buyer’s company.</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">“Why do you think this problem is happening?” “How do you think your current processes are affecting this?” “How has the implementation of this product affected your business?” You always want to provoke your customers to think hard and differently about what’s gone wrong.</div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">If you can confidently identify a problem, show a buyer that you understand the impact it’s having on the business, intelligently articulate the root cause of the problem in industry terms, and offer yourself as someone who can create a perfectly tailored solution to that problem, you’re golden.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 70</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">While you’re going through this discovery process, don’t forget to pepper your conversation with plenty of validating questions. Validation is a common communication strategy promoted by psychologists to strengthen personal relationships. You could say you’re using these validation questions to help strengthen your relationship with your customer by ensuring that they agree with the way you are interpreting their responses.</div>

<div class="book_quote_location">page 76</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">This is a conversation. Let me say that again: you’re having a conversation, not an interrogation, and like all conversations, it’s going to move forward and back and around, and many times your questions and answers will overlap.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 76</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The key is to ask, then listen, then ask, listen, ask, listen.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 76</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The beauty of this is that there is never any reason for you to pressure a customer to buy anything, because by the time you’re done with discovery, they’ll be so aware of their problems, they’ll be begging for your help.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">You know your customers’ current state, future state, and intrinsic motivation. Now you have permission to start talking about your product or service! That’s right, you finally get to pitch. You can start sharing information about what your product does. You can explain why your service is better than that of any other competitor on the market. In other words, you can start selling! Crazy, isn’t it, how much later in the process you start to actually sell when you’re selling to the gap?</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">CHAPTER ELEVEN HOW TO DO A KICKASS DEMO</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 86</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">1. No discovery, no demo</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 86</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">1. Does the prospect have a problem you can fix?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 86</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">2. Does the prospect agree they have a problem? 3. Does the prospect want to fix the problem? 4. Will the prospect go on a journey with you to fix the problem?</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 86</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Instead, if a customer refuses a discovery, inform them that the demo is actually a two-step process, and that without a discovery, it’s impossible to conduct a proper, customized demo.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 86</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">2. No ifs</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 87</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">There is no “if” during a demo because you’re supposed to already know!</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 87</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">But what if you know the potential of your product, and you’ve seen what it can do for a business, and you want your customer to be aware that it can help them in a multitude of ways? Then is it OK to say “if?” No! You’re not focusing on what the customer really cares about if you are presenting for every contingency their business could face. You’ll come off as unfocused, and your customer will feel overwhelmed. Probably bored, too. Maybe even irritated.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 87</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">3. Stick to Six Features</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 87</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">The point of your demo is not to reveal all of your product’s features and functions. It’s to reveal how well your product provides the solution to your buyer’s specific problems.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 88</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">If you’re trying to cram more than six features into your demo, there’s no way you can spend the appropriate amount of time showcasing each.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 88</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">It is always better to spend a lot of time highlighting one feature’s business value than it is to spend a little time introducing a whole bunch of features that may or may not be relevant to solving your buyer’s problems. Think quality, not quantity.</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 88</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">4. Anchor Your Customer</div>
<div class="book_quote_location">page 88</div></div>

<div class="book_quote">
<div class="book_quote_highlight">Throughout your presentation, after every feature demo ask your prospect affirming questions, like this: “Can you see how this feature will improve your churn rate?” “Do you see how this will shorten data input?” “Can you see how this will increase your conversions?” For once, yes or no answers will be acceptable! Getting your customer to affirm the value of every feature you present anchors your prospects in your solution and its effect on shaping their future state. As you paint a powerful vision of the future, make sure your customers see the same one you do.</div>

<div class="book_quote_highlight">It’s not always easy. Challenging your customers without tact, diplomacy, or grace can make them feel incompetent, inattentive, or insecure, which is not conducive to the collaborative, enthusiastic mindset you want your customer to have when you’re gap selling.

<div class="book_quote_highlight">A quarterly commit is about providing accurate insight into what the salesperson can do that quarter with a small (+/- 15%) variance. I know this is hard for many sales managers. What if someone with a $10K a month quota only commits $20K for the quarter? Your instinct might be not to accept it and tell them to go find more “stuff” and come back with a better number. But a low commit to quota isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, finding out ahead of time that your salesperson will miss quota is a gift. Seriously!</div>
